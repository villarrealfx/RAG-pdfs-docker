Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be con\ufb01gured as \u201ccalculated application data infos\u201d, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see \ufb01gure 61 on page 157). 2. Select the Calculation Worksheet by clicking the radio button Calculation in the work- sheet selection group of the Detail Block. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the Calculation Worksheet has already been selected in step 1. 3. Select the desired application data info from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the application data info has already been selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet in step 1. 4. SDM performs a query on the calculation attributes of the selected application data info. The available calculation attributes will be listed in the Operands Tabular List the of the Calculation Worksheet. 5. Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. \u261e Note: The desired formula must have been de\ufb01ned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speci\ufb01es the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2. Create a reference between a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference \u201cterminal\u201d in the column Ref- erence. 3.", "Apply your entry by pressing the Apply button or the OK button in the Command Block of the Application Data Info Form.

After a calculation formula has been selected and at least one calculation operand has been speci\ufb01ed, the text \ufb01eld of the attribute For- mula will be protected and the assigned formula cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A calculation formula can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available calculation formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or by selecting a formula name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formu- la. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those formulae whose result data type corresponds to the data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the main info value of the selected application data info is a boolean value, the list of values shows only those formulae whose result is a boolean. Operands Tabular List \u25a0 Operand Contains the name of the respective calculation operand. A calculation operand can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the operand\u2019s name into the re- spective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand or by selecting an operand name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand. \u261e Note: The number of calculation operands is pre-de\ufb01ned and may vary depending on the se- lected formula. The list of values shows only those calculation operands that are re- quired for the calculation of the selected formula. If all required calculation operands have been speci\ufb01ed, the de\ufb01nition of further calcu- lation operands will be rejected. An appropriate system message will appear. \u25a0 Type Contains the operand type.

The operand type can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the name of the operand type into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type or by selecting an operand type name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type. \u261e Note: Application Data Forms The possibility to use a certain operand type for the respective operand depends on the de\ufb01nition of the selected formula.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet.

SDM Toolbar In addition to the standard toolbar buttons described in section \u2019The Basic Structure of SDM Forms\u2019 on page 19 in this document, the SDM Toolbar of the Archive Filter Form con- tains the following button: \u25a0 Update When this button is pressed, all TAs matching the \ufb01lter criteria de\ufb01ned in the Filter Def- inition Block are entered into the TA Table of the Filter TAs Worksheet. Filter De\ufb01nition Block \u25a0 Filter Name In this line a name for the \ufb01lter can be entered. The following two lines serve for the de\ufb01nition of \ufb01lter criteria that are used to determine a number of appropriate technological addresses for the TA Table. These technological ad- dresses are visible in the TA Table when the Filter TAs Worksheet is selected. For updating the TA Table after the \ufb01lter de\ufb01nition has been changed, press button Update. Address syntax speci\ufb01cations may consist both of block names (substation names, feeder names, etc.) and block type names. For each parameter of both lines, the wildcard symbol (\u201c*\u201d) may be used. Usage of a wild- card symbol means that the technological addresses must be determined with all available network image entries of the respective parameter. The explicitly speci\ufb01ed parameters re- main unchanged. Archive Filter Form The mixed usage of both input lines and usage of the wildcard symbol is subject to the fol- lowing restrictions: \u25a0 Usage of a wildcard symbol for the parameter B1 is not possible and will be rejected. \u25a0 Inputs in \ufb01elds located one below the other are mutually exclusive. Direct TA Input \u25a0 B1-Name \u25a0 B2-Name \u25a0 B3-Name \u25a0 Element-Name \u25a0 Info-Name In this line only block names may be speci\ufb01ed.

Worksheet Selection Group The Worksheet Selection Group contains two radiobuttons for selecting either the Direct TAs Worksheet or the Filter TAs Worksheet. TA Table The TA Table consists of the following columns: \u25a0 B1-Name \u25a0 B2-Name \u25a0 B3-Name \u25a0 Element-Name Archive Filter Form \u25a0 Info-Name \u25a0 Job Interlock The content of the TA Table depends on the selected worksheet. Direct TAs Worksheet In this worksheet you can directly insert or delete a technological address (a modi\ufb01cation is not possible). The \ufb01ve parameters specify the technological address of a \ufb01lter entry, i.e., the technological address of a data entry that will be stored. Operating of the parameters Elem and Info is subject to the following restrictions: \u25a0 For value archives, only elements with the appropriate standard element type (pre-de- \ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition) may be selected or entered. Element speci\ufb01cations without the appropriate standard element type are automatically replaced by the \ufb01rst element found in the database having the pre-de\ufb01ned standard element type. Also, the input \ufb01eld for the parameter Info is locked as this parameter is pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition. For message archives, this input \ufb01eld is released. The standard element type and info pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition are displayed in the Master Block. \u25a0 In case of special value archives, the input \ufb01eld of the parameter Info is operable only if the parameter Info has been marked as irrelevant during archive de\ufb01nition (usage of the wildcard symbol). If the parameters Standard Element and Info have not been marked as irrelevant dur- ing archive de\ufb01nition (usage of a valid standard element and/or info), they are subject to the restrictions described for regular value archives (see previous bullet). Filter TAs Worksheet In this worksheet the TA Table displays all technological addresses matching the criteria en- tered in the Filter De\ufb01nition Block.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record de\ufb01nitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section \u2019Data Collection Guidelines\u2019 on page 297 and section \u2019General Format Guidelines\u2019 on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: \u25a0 AD_INFO \u25a0 AD_REFERENCE \u25a0 SCHEDULE \u25a0 AD_CALC_INFO \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_GROUP \u25a0 AD_CHARAC \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in \ufb01les. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions Throughout this document, the term \u201crecord\u201d is de\ufb01ned as a string of characters subdivided into data item \ufb01elds that are delimited by some record separator. Each \ufb01eld is used for the entry of data values for speci\ufb01c attributes of power system equipment and other entities. \u261e Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.", "6. Paste the technological addresses from the internal clipboard into the currently select- ed data record of your SDM form by pressing the button Paste in the SDM Toolbar of the respective SDM form. \u261e Note: If the cursor is currently located in a tabular list and you are going to paste several technological addresses, the technological addresses will be inserted in the appropri- ate columns of successive rows in the list. For example: Let\u2019s assume your SDM form contains a tabular list with columns repre- senting a technological address. Your cursor is currently located in the \ufb01rst row of this list. Now, you perform a query using the Query Window and you copy and paste 3 technological addresses. The \ufb01rst technological address will be inserted into the ap- propriate columns of the row where the cursor is located, the second technological ad- dress in the appropriate columns of the next row, and so on. The List Of Values (LOV) Feature Any attribute of a data entity may have an associated static list of valid values. This list may either be de\ufb01ned in the concerned database table of the source database or may be estab- lished for the concerned form component during the form creation. SDM Basics SDM forms support these lists by the List Of Values (LOV) feature. A list of values is a scrol- lable list in a separate window that pops up if you double-click on an input \ufb01eld that has an assigned list of valid values (for an example, see \ufb01gure 4 on page 14). List of Values Window The List of Values Window contains a scrollable pick list that shows a list of single-column or multi-column entries from which you can select a single, distinct value (in case of sin- gle-column entries) or a set of values (in case of multi-column entries). The list entries cor- respond to columns in a database table or to static values that have been established during the form creation (see \ufb01rst paragraph of the section \u2019The List Of Values (LOV) Feature\u2019 above). FIGURE  4 Example of a List of Values Window A list of values appears as a modal window which can be moved and resized. It contains the following components: \u25a0 Find \ufb01eld The Find \ufb01eld can be used to search speci\ufb01c list entries (refer to the section \u2019Search- ing speci\ufb01c list entries\u2019 on page 15 for further details). \u25a0 List panel The List panel shows the LOV entries (single-column entries or multi-column entries).

The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record.

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be con\ufb01gured as \u201ccalculated application data infos\u201d, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see \ufb01gure 61 on page 157). 2. Select the Calculation Worksheet by clicking the radio button Calculation in the work- sheet selection group of the Detail Block. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the Calculation Worksheet has already been selected in step 1. 3. Select the desired application data info from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the application data info has already been selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet in step 1. 4. SDM performs a query on the calculation attributes of the selected application data info. The available calculation attributes will be listed in the Operands Tabular List the of the Calculation Worksheet. 5. Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. \u261e Note: The desired formula must have been de\ufb01ned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speci\ufb01es the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2.

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be con\ufb01gured as \u201ccalculated application data infos\u201d, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158.

Calculation Worksheet Clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group selects the Calculation Worksheet in the worksheet block. Application Data Forms FIGURE  64 Calculation Worksheet The Calculation Worksheet consists of the Result Block and the Operands Tabular List. Each line of the tabular list of operands contains the attribute settings of one single calcu- lation operand. The column Operand shows the name of the respective calculation oper- and, the columns Type, Constant, and B1-Name ... Info-Name contain the attribute set- tings of the respective calculation operand. Result Block \u25a0 Info Name A pop-list that contains the names of the available application data infos. The list item shows the name of the selected application data info. Another application data info may be selected from this pop-list at any time. \u261e Note: The pop-list Info Name contains only calculated application data infos, i.e., application data infos whose input mode has been set to SDM (see input mode description on page 161 for further details). The number of the contained application data infos is not af- fected by the selected worksheet view (see description of the Worksheet View Selec- tion Pop-List in the section \u2019Worksheet View Selection Pop-List\u2019 on page 159 in this document). \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Formula Contains the name of the assigned calculation formula. Result Block Operands Tabular List Application Data Forms \u261e Note: The formula assignment can only be modi\ufb01ed if no operand has been speci\ufb01ed (i.e., the Operands Tabular List is empty). After a calculation formula has been selected and at least one calculation operand has been speci\ufb01ed, the text \ufb01eld of the attribute For- mula will be protected and the assigned formula cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A calculation formula can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available calculation formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or by selecting a formula name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formu- la. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those formulae whose result data type corresponds to the data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the main info value of the selected application data info is a boolean value, the list of values shows only those formulae whose result is a boolean. Operands Tabular List \u25a0 Operand Contains the name of the respective calculation operand. A calculation operand can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the operand\u2019s name into the re- spective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand or by selecting an operand name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand. \u261e Note: The number of calculation operands is pre-de\ufb01ned and may vary depending on the se- lected formula. The list of values shows only those calculation operands that are re- quired for the calculation of the selected formula. If all required calculation operands have been speci\ufb01ed, the de\ufb01nition of further calcu- lation operands will be rejected. An appropriate system message will appear. \u25a0 Type Contains the operand type. The operand type speci\ufb01es whether the value of the oper- and is a constant or is taken from a separate info speci\ufb01ed by a technological address. In the latter case, the attribute setting also speci\ufb01es whether the value must negated or not. The operand type can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the name of the operand type into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type or by selecting an operand type name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type. \u261e Note: Application Data Forms The possibility to use a certain operand type for the respective operand depends on the de\ufb01nition of the selected formula.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2. Create a reference between a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference \u201cterminal\u201d in the column Ref- erence. 3.", "5.

Filter De\ufb01nition Block \u25a0 Filter Name In this line a name for the \ufb01lter can be entered. The following two lines serve for the de\ufb01nition of \ufb01lter criteria that are used to determine a number of appropriate technological addresses for the TA Table.

Direct TAs Worksheet In this worksheet you can directly insert or delete a technological address (a modi\ufb01cation is not possible). The \ufb01ve parameters specify the technological address of a \ufb01lter entry, i.e., the technological address of a data entry that will be stored. Operating of the parameters Elem and Info is subject to the following restrictions: \u25a0 For value archives, only elements with the appropriate standard element type (pre-de- \ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition) may be selected or entered. Element speci\ufb01cations without the appropriate standard element type are automatically replaced by the \ufb01rst element found in the database having the pre-de\ufb01ned standard element type. Also, the input \ufb01eld for the parameter Info is locked as this parameter is pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition. For message archives, this input \ufb01eld is released. The standard element type and info pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition are displayed in the Master Block. \u25a0 In case of special value archives, the input \ufb01eld of the parameter Info is operable only if the parameter Info has been marked as irrelevant during archive de\ufb01nition (usage of the wildcard symbol). If the parameters Standard Element and Info have not been marked as irrelevant dur- ing archive de\ufb01nition (usage of a valid standard element and/or info), they are subject to the restrictions described for regular value archives (see previous bullet). Filter TAs Worksheet In this worksheet the TA Table displays all technological addresses matching the criteria en- tered in the Filter De\ufb01nition Block.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record de\ufb01nitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section \u2019Data Collection Guidelines\u2019 on page 297 and section \u2019General Format Guidelines\u2019 on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: \u25a0 AD_INFO \u25a0 AD_REFERENCE \u25a0 SCHEDULE \u25a0 AD_CALC_INFO \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_GROUP \u25a0 AD_CHARAC \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in \ufb01les. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions Throughout this document, the term \u201crecord\u201d is de\ufb01ned as a string of characters subdivided into data item \ufb01elds that are delimited by some record separator. Each \ufb01eld is used for the entry of data values for speci\ufb01c attributes of power system equipment and other entities. \u261e Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.", "6. Paste the technological addresses from the internal clipboard into the currently select- ed data record of your SDM form by pressing the button Paste in the SDM Toolbar of the respective SDM form. \u261e Note: If the cursor is currently located in a tabular list and you are going to paste several technological addresses, the technological addresses will be inserted in the appropri- ate columns of successive rows in the list. For example: Let\u2019s assume your SDM form contains a tabular list with columns repre- senting a technological address. Your cursor is currently located in the \ufb01rst row of this list. Now, you perform a query using the Query Window and you copy and paste 3 technological addresses. The \ufb01rst technological address will be inserted into the ap- propriate columns of the row where the cursor is located, the second technological ad- dress in the appropriate columns of the next row, and so on. The List Of Values (LOV) Feature Any attribute of a data entity may have an associated static list of valid values. This list may either be de\ufb01ned in the concerned database table of the source database or may be estab- lished for the concerned form component during the form creation. SDM Basics SDM forms support these lists by the List Of Values (LOV) feature. A list of values is a scrol- lable list in a separate window that pops up if you double-click on an input \ufb01eld that has an assigned list of valid values (for an example, see \ufb01gure 4 on page 14). List of Values Window The List of Values Window contains a scrollable pick list that shows a list of single-column or multi-column entries from which you can select a single, distinct value (in case of sin- gle-column entries) or a set of values (in case of multi-column entries). The list entries cor- respond to columns in a database table or to static values that have been established during the form creation (see \ufb01rst paragraph of the section \u2019The List Of Values (LOV) Feature\u2019 above). FIGURE  4 Example of a List of Values Window A list of values appears as a modal window which can be moved and resized. It contains the following components: \u25a0 Find \ufb01eld The Find \ufb01eld can be used to search speci\ufb01c list entries (refer to the section \u2019Search- ing speci\ufb01c list entries\u2019 on page 15 for further details). \u25a0 List panel The List panel shows the LOV entries (single-column entries or multi-column entries).

Organizational SDM Forms Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form can be selected from the menu Tools in the SDM Menubar and from other SDM forms (refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for details). It provides facilities that allow you to create IDD \ufb01les for ASCII data import from the data of the Operational Database (ODB). FIGURE  35 Basic Structure of the Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form is composed of the following components: \u25a0 SDM Menubar \u25a0 Message Line \u25a0 Status Line These form components are common in all SDM forms. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding sections in chapter 3, section \u2019SDM Basics\u2019 on page 3 in this document. \u25a0 Detail Block This form component is described in detail in the following section. SDM Menubar Message Line Status Line Detail Block Organizational SDM Forms Detail Block The Detail Block of the Reverse Transfer Form provides the following attributes: \u25a0 Subsystem Radiobuttons for selection of the subsystem: \u2013 SCADA \u2013 TCI \u2013 Elcom \u2013 ICCP \u2013 NA \u2013 DT \u2013 Type \u2013 Control Data \u25a0 Hierarchy Name Radiobuttons for selection of B1 or Application Data or Connection (if B1 or Application Data is selected, then a \ufb01eld for input of a B1 name is provided). These radiobuttons are only provided, if subsystem SCADA has been selected.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record de\ufb01nitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section \u2019Data Collection Guidelines\u2019 on page 297 and section \u2019General Format Guidelines\u2019 on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: \u25a0 AD_INFO \u25a0 AD_REFERENCE \u25a0 SCHEDULE \u25a0 AD_CALC_INFO \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_GROUP \u25a0 AD_CHARAC \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in \ufb01les. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions Throughout this document, the term \u201crecord\u201d is de\ufb01ned as a string of characters subdivided into data item \ufb01elds that are delimited by some record separator. Each \ufb01eld is used for the entry of data values for speci\ufb01c attributes of power system equipment and other entities. \u261e Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.", "B1 name, B2 name, B3 name, element name and info name are necessary. \u25a0 U If this checkbox is selected, it indicates that the condition can be unlocked by a com- mand from the operator during supervisory control.

Decision Table Forms Rules Worksheet FIGURE  99 Basic structure of the Global Area Interlocking Conditions Form - Rules Worksheet The Rules Worksheet consists of a tabular list for entering conditions for each object to be tested. It is not possible to add or delete condition lines in this worksheet. Below the tabular list four buttons for scrolling through all rules are provided, as only a limited number of rules can be displayed at a time. The tabular list consists of the following columns: \u25a0 F \u25a0 Code Word \u25a0 U \u25a0 Abbreviation SDM Toolbar SDM Menubar Job Block Command Block Detail Block Message Line Status Line Master Block Decision Table Forms These columns show the information entered in the Parameters Worksheet. They can- not be modi\ufb01ed in this worksheet. \u25a0 Rule <n> These columns can be used for de\ufb01ning rules. A rule results from the total amount of conditions displayed vertically below a rule number. Adding new rules or deleting ex- isting rules can be performed with buttons Insert Rule, Delete Rule and Duplicate Rule described below. \u261e During on-line processing the system takes the rules one after the other beginning with rule 1. If a rule is ful\ufb01lled, the processing is stopped. This must be taken into con- sideration when de\ufb01ning the decision tables. When the Rules Worksheet is selected, the SDM Toolbar additionally contains the following buttons: \u25a0 Insert Rule This button is used to insert a new rule in the decision table.

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be con\ufb01gured as \u201ccalculated application data infos\u201d, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see \ufb01gure 61 on page 157). 2. Select the Calculation Worksheet by clicking the radio button Calculation in the work- sheet selection group of the Detail Block. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the Calculation Worksheet has already been selected in step 1. 3. Select the desired application data info from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the application data info has already been selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet in step 1. 4. SDM performs a query on the calculation attributes of the selected application data info. The available calculation attributes will be listed in the Operands Tabular List the of the Calculation Worksheet. 5. Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. \u261e Note: The desired formula must have been de\ufb01ned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speci\ufb01es the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2.

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be con\ufb01gured as \u201ccalculated application data infos\u201d, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see \ufb01gure 61 on page 157). 2. Select the Calculation Worksheet by clicking the radio button Calculation in the work- sheet selection group of the Detail Block. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the Calculation Worksheet has already been selected in step 1. 3. Select the desired application data info from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the application data info has already been selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet in step 1. 4. SDM performs a query on the calculation attributes of the selected application data info. The available calculation attributes will be listed in the Operands Tabular List the of the Calculation Worksheet. 5. Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. \u261e Note: The desired formula must have been de\ufb01ned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speci\ufb01es the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.", "Enter the calculation operand data. For each operand, enter a unique operand identi\ufb01er into the concerned text \ufb01eld of the column Operand and a operand type into the concerned text \ufb01eld of the column Type in the Operands Tabular List or choose these information from the related lists of val- ues. \u261e Note: The required number of operands and the individual operand types depend on the used formula. Be aware that some operand types might not be applicable for an oper- and of a certain formula. The ability to enter values for the attributes Constant and B1-Name ... Info-Name also depends on the operand type. \u261e Note: For detailed information on the text \ufb01elds of the Calculation Worksheet, their relations and dependencies, refer to the subsequent section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167. Calculation Worksheet Clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group selects the Calculation Worksheet in the worksheet block. Application Data Forms FIGURE  64 Calculation Worksheet The Calculation Worksheet consists of the Result Block and the Operands Tabular List. Each line of the tabular list of operands contains the attribute settings of one single calcu- lation operand. The column Operand shows the name of the respective calculation oper- and, the columns Type, Constant, and B1-Name ... Info-Name contain the attribute set- tings of the respective calculation operand. Result Block \u25a0 Info Name A pop-list that contains the names of the available application data infos. The list item shows the name of the selected application data info. Another application data info may be selected from this pop-list at any time. \u261e Note: The pop-list Info Name contains only calculated application data infos, i.e., application data infos whose input mode has been set to SDM (see input mode description on page 161 for further details). The number of the contained application data infos is not af- fected by the selected worksheet view (see description of the Worksheet View Selec- tion Pop-List in the section \u2019Worksheet View Selection Pop-List\u2019 on page 159 in this document). \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Formula Contains the name of the assigned calculation formula. Result Block Operands Tabular List Application Data Forms \u261e Note: The formula assignment can only be modi\ufb01ed if no operand has been speci\ufb01ed (i.e., the Operands Tabular List is empty). After a calculation formula has been selected and at least one calculation operand has been speci\ufb01ed, the text \ufb01eld of the attribute For- mula will be protected and the assigned formula cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A calculation formula can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available calculation formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or by selecting a formula name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formu- la. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those formulae whose result data type corresponds to the data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the main info value of the selected application data info is a boolean value, the list of values shows only those formulae whose result is a boolean. Operands Tabular List \u25a0 Operand Contains the name of the respective calculation operand. A calculation operand can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the operand\u2019s name into the re- spective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand or by selecting an operand name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand. \u261e Note: The number of calculation operands is pre-de\ufb01ned and may vary depending on the se- lected formula. The list of values shows only those calculation operands that are re- quired for the calculation of the selected formula. If all required calculation operands have been speci\ufb01ed, the de\ufb01nition of further calcu- lation operands will be rejected. An appropriate system message will appear. \u25a0 Type Contains the operand type. The operand type speci\ufb01es whether the value of the oper- and is a constant or is taken from a separate info speci\ufb01ed by a technological address. In the latter case, the attribute setting also speci\ufb01es whether the value must negated or not. The operand type can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the name of the operand type into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type or by selecting an operand type name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type. \u261e Note: Application Data Forms The possibility to use a certain operand type for the respective operand depends on the de\ufb01nition of the selected formula.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2. Create a reference between a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference \u201cterminal\u201d in the column Ref- erence. 3.", "5. Modify the selected attribute. Enter the new attribute value into the selected text \ufb01eld or double-click on the con- cerned text \ufb01eld to open a list of values and choose the desired value from the list of values. \u261e Note: Be aware that some attributes cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A possible reason for this behavior may be the setting of the Worksheet View Selection Pop-List (see description on page 159). For further information on application data info attributes and the associated text \ufb01elds, refer to the subsequent section \u2019Application Data Info Worksheet\u2019 on page 159.

Direct TAs Worksheet In this worksheet you can directly insert or delete a technological address (a modi\ufb01cation is not possible). The \ufb01ve parameters specify the technological address of a \ufb01lter entry, i.e., the technological address of a data entry that will be stored. Operating of the parameters Elem and Info is subject to the following restrictions: \u25a0 For value archives, only elements with the appropriate standard element type (pre-de- \ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition) may be selected or entered. Element speci\ufb01cations without the appropriate standard element type are automatically replaced by the \ufb01rst element found in the database having the pre-de\ufb01ned standard element type. Also, the input \ufb01eld for the parameter Info is locked as this parameter is pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition. For message archives, this input \ufb01eld is released. The standard element type and info pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition are displayed in the Master Block. \u25a0 In case of special value archives, the input \ufb01eld of the parameter Info is operable only if the parameter Info has been marked as irrelevant during archive de\ufb01nition (usage of the wildcard symbol). If the parameters Standard Element and Info have not been marked as irrelevant dur- ing archive de\ufb01nition (usage of a valid standard element and/or info), they are subject to the restrictions described for regular value archives (see previous bullet). Filter TAs Worksheet In this worksheet the TA Table displays all technological addresses matching the criteria en- tered in the Filter De\ufb01nition Block.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record de\ufb01nitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section \u2019Data Collection Guidelines\u2019 on page 297 and section \u2019General Format Guidelines\u2019 on page 299.

The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.", "6. Paste the technological addresses from the internal clipboard into the currently select- ed data record of your SDM form by pressing the button Paste in the SDM Toolbar of the respective SDM form. \u261e Note: If the cursor is currently located in a tabular list and you are going to paste several technological addresses, the technological addresses will be inserted in the appropri- ate columns of successive rows in the list. For example: Let\u2019s assume your SDM form contains a tabular list with columns repre- senting a technological address. Your cursor is currently located in the \ufb01rst row of this list. Now, you perform a query using the Query Window and you copy and paste 3 technological addresses. The \ufb01rst technological address will be inserted into the ap- propriate columns of the row where the cursor is located, the second technological ad- dress in the appropriate columns of the next row, and so on. The List Of Values (LOV) Feature Any attribute of a data entity may have an associated static list of valid values. This list may either be de\ufb01ned in the concerned database table of the source database or may be estab- lished for the concerned form component during the form creation. SDM Basics SDM forms support these lists by the List Of Values (LOV) feature. A list of values is a scrol- lable list in a separate window that pops up if you double-click on an input \ufb01eld that has an assigned list of valid values (for an example, see \ufb01gure 4 on page 14). List of Values Window The List of Values Window contains a scrollable pick list that shows a list of single-column or multi-column entries from which you can select a single, distinct value (in case of sin- gle-column entries) or a set of values (in case of multi-column entries). The list entries cor- respond to columns in a database table or to static values that have been established during the form creation (see \ufb01rst paragraph of the section \u2019The List Of Values (LOV) Feature\u2019 above). FIGURE  4 Example of a List of Values Window A list of values appears as a modal window which can be moved and resized. It contains the following components: \u25a0 Find \ufb01eld The Find \ufb01eld can be used to search speci\ufb01c list entries (refer to the section \u2019Search- ing speci\ufb01c list entries\u2019 on page 15 for further details). \u25a0 List panel The List panel shows the LOV entries (single-column entries or multi-column entries).

Organizational SDM Forms Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form can be selected from the menu Tools in the SDM Menubar and from other SDM forms (refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for details). It provides facilities that allow you to create IDD \ufb01les for ASCII data import from the data of the Operational Database (ODB). FIGURE  35 Basic Structure of the Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form is composed of the following components: \u25a0 SDM Menubar \u25a0 Message Line \u25a0 Status Line These form components are common in all SDM forms. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding sections in chapter 3, section \u2019SDM Basics\u2019 on page 3 in this document. \u25a0 Detail Block This form component is described in detail in the following section. SDM Menubar Message Line Status Line Detail Block Organizational SDM Forms Detail Block The Detail Block of the Reverse Transfer Form provides the following attributes: \u25a0 Subsystem Radiobuttons for selection of the subsystem: \u2013 SCADA \u2013 TCI \u2013 Elcom \u2013 ICCP \u2013 NA \u2013 DT \u2013 Type \u2013 Control Data \u25a0 Hierarchy Name Radiobuttons for selection of B1 or Application Data or Connection (if B1 or Application Data is selected, then a \ufb01eld for input of a B1 name is provided). These radiobuttons are only provided, if subsystem SCADA has been selected.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h .

For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding sections in chapter \u2019SDM Basics\u2019 on page 3 in this document. \u25a0 Detail Block Detail Block of the Multisite Form The Detail Block of the Multisite Form consists of a tabular list for entering multisite data for the block de\ufb01ned in the Master Block. This tabular list consists of the following columns: \u25a0 Control Center Name In this \ufb01eld you can enter the name of the control center for which you want to enter the multisite data. \u25a0 Master Priority This \ufb01eld determines, whether the control center is master system for the block de- \ufb01ned in the Master Block, as well as its priority. The following input is allowed: \u2013 0 Entering \u201c0\u201d means that this control center is not master system for this block. \u2013 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 Entering numbers \u201c1\u201d to \u201c4\u201d determines the master priority of the control center. A lower number means a higher priority (there may be no gaps when de\ufb01ning the master priority - e.g.: priority \u201c3\u201d may only be de\ufb01ned for a control center, if there are also control centers with priority \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d for this block). \u25a0 Control Permission This \ufb01eld determines, whether the control center can have control permission for this block.", "\u25a0 Job ID This \ufb01eld displays the number used for identifying the speci\ufb01ed job. Organizational SDM Forms Command Block The Command Block contains the following buttons: \u25a0 Cancel Exits the Task Log Form. If you press this button, the Task Log Form will be closed and the Job Management Form will appear. \u25a0 Cancel Last Task This button allows you to cancel the most recently completed task, thereby removing any data changes made by that task from the database. You can cancel all of the tasks associated with a job, but each task must be cancelled individually and in the reverse order of how it was performed. \u25a0 Clear Task Errors This function clears the errors for the selected task in the Task Information Block and sets the error number in the Errors \ufb01eld to zero. \u25a0 Clear Job Errors This function clears the errors for all tasks of the speci\ufb01ed job. \u25a0 Clear Task Trace This function clears the trace messages for the selected task in the Task Information Block. \u25a0 Clear Job Trace This function clears the trace messages for all tasks of the speci\ufb01ed job. Task Information Block The following parameters are shown in the Task Information Block: \u25a0 Task ID This is a chronological number to record the tasks performed. \u25a0 Task Name It is the name of a particular task. This name is generated automatically by the system according to the speci\ufb01ed task. \u25a0 Creation This \ufb01eld indicates the date and time for the creation of the task. \u25a0 Creation Username Shows the username of the operator who has created the respective task. \u25a0 Errors The number of errors appeared for the speci\ufb01ed task. Organizational SDM Forms \u25a0 Infos The number of informational messages appeared for the selected task. Organizational SDM Forms Task Error Log Form The Task Error Log Form allows you to view the chronology of the tasks containing errors for a particular job. The form can be selected under the menu Job in the SDM Menubar. Each task which contains errors and its identifying parameters are shown in one line of the Task Information Block. There is a scrollbar at the right side of the list to scroll the list, as there can be more tasks de\ufb01ned than one page can show. FIGURE  33 Basic Structure of the Task Error Log Form This form is identically constructed as the Task Log Form. The difference is that only the tasks which involve errors are displayed and the Cancel Last Task button is always disabled.

Command Block The Command Block of the Model Form differs from the standard Command Block con- tained in a SDM form (see section \u2019Command Block\u2019 on page 26 for details). It contains the following buttons: \u25a0 Apply Creates the object according to the entered data. \u25a0 Cancel Exits the Model Form. If you press this button, the Model Form will be closed and the Job Management Form will appear. \u261e Note: If you have not applied your entries by pressing the button Apply in the Command Block, they will be dismissed. Toolbar of the Model Form The Model Form contains a toolbar that differs from the standard SDM Toolbar (see section \u2019SDM Toolbar\u2019 on page 21 for details). It provides the following button: \u25a0 Msg Opens the Error Message Form to show error messages of the concerned job. For more details on the Error Message Form, refer to the section \u2019Error Message Form\u2019 on page 72. Detail Block The Detail Block provides the following attributes: \u25a0 Model Level Contains the model level, i.e., the hierarchical level of the data hierarchy to be copied. \u25a0 Change Detection Organizational SDM Forms Checkbox to select whether changes shall be detected and recorded in the change log. \u25a0 Model Connectivity Information Checkbox to select whether the connectivity information of the model data hierarchy shall be copied. \u25a0 Model Network Analysis Data Checkbox to select whether the network analysis data of the model data hierarchy shall be copied.

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be con\ufb01gured as \u201ccalculated application data infos\u201d, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see \ufb01gure 61 on page 157). 2. Select the Calculation Worksheet by clicking the radio button Calculation in the work- sheet selection group of the Detail Block. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the Calculation Worksheet has already been selected in step 1. 3. Select the desired application data info from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the application data info has already been selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet in step 1. 4. SDM performs a query on the calculation attributes of the selected application data info. The available calculation attributes will be listed in the Operands Tabular List the of the Calculation Worksheet. 5. Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. \u261e Note: The desired formula must have been de\ufb01ned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speci\ufb01es the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2. Create a reference between a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference \u201cterminal\u201d in the column Ref- erence. 3.", "Apply your entry by pressing the Apply button or the OK button in the Command Block of the Application Data Info Form.

After a calculation formula has been selected and at least one calculation operand has been speci\ufb01ed, the text \ufb01eld of the attribute For- mula will be protected and the assigned formula cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A calculation formula can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available calculation formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or by selecting a formula name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formu- la. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those formulae whose result data type corresponds to the data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the main info value of the selected application data info is a boolean value, the list of values shows only those formulae whose result is a boolean. Operands Tabular List \u25a0 Operand Contains the name of the respective calculation operand. A calculation operand can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the operand\u2019s name into the re- spective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand or by selecting an operand name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand. \u261e Note: The number of calculation operands is pre-de\ufb01ned and may vary depending on the se- lected formula. The list of values shows only those calculation operands that are re- quired for the calculation of the selected formula. If all required calculation operands have been speci\ufb01ed, the de\ufb01nition of further calcu- lation operands will be rejected. An appropriate system message will appear. \u25a0 Type Contains the operand type.

For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info.

A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2. Create a reference between a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference \u201cterminal\u201d in the column Ref- erence. 3.", "5. Modify the selected attribute. Enter the new attribute value into the selected text \ufb01eld or double-click on the con- cerned text \ufb01eld to open a list of values and choose the desired value from the list of values. \u261e Note: Be aware that some attributes cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A possible reason for this behavior may be the setting of the Worksheet View Selection Pop-List (see description on page 159). For further information on application data info attributes and the associated text \ufb01elds, refer to the subsequent section \u2019Application Data Info Worksheet\u2019 on page 159. Modi\ufb01cations of additional information associated with application data infos are pos- sible, too. For more information on this topic, refer to the sections \u2019Additional Informa- Application Data Forms tion Window Button\u2019 on page 160 and \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171. 6. Apply your modi\ufb01cations by pressing the Apply button or the OK button in the Com- mand Block of the Application Data Info Form. Pressing the Cancel button in the Com- mand Block of the Application Data Info Form dismisses the attribute modi\ufb01cations. For more details on the buttons of the Command Block, refer to the section \u2019Command Block\u2019 on page 26. \u261e Note: It is not necessary to press the button Apply each time you have entered a single at- tribute value. You may also perform all desired data modi\ufb01cations on a single data record \ufb01rst and then press the button Apply to apply all data modi\ufb01cations. Application Data Info Worksheet The Application Data Info Worksheet may be selected in the Detail Block of the Application Data Info Form by clicking the radio button AD Info in the worksheet selection group. The Application Data Info Tabular List and the Worksheet View Selection Pop-List appear. After the selection of an application data info from the Application Data Info Tabular List, a button for the selection of an additional information window may appear, too.

The \ufb01ve parameters specify the technological address of a \ufb01lter entry, i.e., the technological address of a data entry that will be stored. Operating of the parameters Elem and Info is subject to the following restrictions: \u25a0 For value archives, only elements with the appropriate standard element type (pre-de- \ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition) may be selected or entered. Element speci\ufb01cations without the appropriate standard element type are automatically replaced by the \ufb01rst element found in the database having the pre-de\ufb01ned standard element type. Also, the input \ufb01eld for the parameter Info is locked as this parameter is pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition. For message archives, this input \ufb01eld is released. The standard element type and info pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition are displayed in the Master Block. \u25a0 In case of special value archives, the input \ufb01eld of the parameter Info is operable only if the parameter Info has been marked as irrelevant during archive de\ufb01nition (usage of the wildcard symbol). If the parameters Standard Element and Info have not been marked as irrelevant dur- ing archive de\ufb01nition (usage of a valid standard element and/or info), they are subject to the restrictions described for regular value archives (see previous bullet). Filter TAs Worksheet In this worksheet the TA Table displays all technological addresses matching the criteria en- tered in the Filter De\ufb01nition Block.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record de\ufb01nitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section \u2019Data Collection Guidelines\u2019 on page 297 and section \u2019General Format Guidelines\u2019 on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: \u25a0 AD_INFO \u25a0 AD_REFERENCE \u25a0 SCHEDULE \u25a0 AD_CALC_INFO \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_GROUP \u25a0 AD_CHARAC \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in \ufb01les. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions Throughout this document, the term \u201crecord\u201d is de\ufb01ned as a string of characters subdivided into data item \ufb01elds that are delimited by some record separator. Each \ufb01eld is used for the entry of data values for speci\ufb01c attributes of power system equipment and other entities. \u261e Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.", "6. Paste the technological addresses from the internal clipboard into the currently select- ed data record of your SDM form by pressing the button Paste in the SDM Toolbar of the respective SDM form. \u261e Note: If the cursor is currently located in a tabular list and you are going to paste several technological addresses, the technological addresses will be inserted in the appropri- ate columns of successive rows in the list. For example: Let\u2019s assume your SDM form contains a tabular list with columns repre- senting a technological address. Your cursor is currently located in the \ufb01rst row of this list. Now, you perform a query using the Query Window and you copy and paste 3 technological addresses. The \ufb01rst technological address will be inserted into the ap- propriate columns of the row where the cursor is located, the second technological ad- dress in the appropriate columns of the next row, and so on. The List Of Values (LOV) Feature Any attribute of a data entity may have an associated static list of valid values. This list may either be de\ufb01ned in the concerned database table of the source database or may be estab- lished for the concerned form component during the form creation. SDM Basics SDM forms support these lists by the List Of Values (LOV) feature. A list of values is a scrol- lable list in a separate window that pops up if you double-click on an input \ufb01eld that has an assigned list of valid values (for an example, see \ufb01gure 4 on page 14). List of Values Window The List of Values Window contains a scrollable pick list that shows a list of single-column or multi-column entries from which you can select a single, distinct value (in case of sin- gle-column entries) or a set of values (in case of multi-column entries). The list entries cor- respond to columns in a database table or to static values that have been established during the form creation (see \ufb01rst paragraph of the section \u2019The List Of Values (LOV) Feature\u2019 above). FIGURE  4 Example of a List of Values Window A list of values appears as a modal window which can be moved and resized. It contains the following components: \u25a0 Find \ufb01eld The Find \ufb01eld can be used to search speci\ufb01c list entries (refer to the section \u2019Search- ing speci\ufb01c list entries\u2019 on page 15 for further details). \u25a0 List panel The List panel shows the LOV entries (single-column entries or multi-column entries). Scrollable pick list Find \ufb01eld List panel SDM Basics \u25a0 Three buttons \u2013 Find \u2013 OK \u2013 Cancel Selecting a value from the list of values To select a value from a list of values, perform one of the following procedures: \u25a0 Double-click on the desired list entry The value will be selected and the List of Values Window will be dismissed automati- cally. \u25a0 Highlight a value by clicking on the desired list entry The value will be only be highlighted. \u25a0 Click on the desired list entry or on the highlighted list entry and dismiss the list of val- ues by pressing the button OK in the List of Values Window The value will be selected. The List of Values Window will be dismissed after the but- ton OK has been pressed. \u25a0 Dismiss the List of Values Window without choosing a value by pressing the button Cancel in the List of Values Window Searching speci\ufb01c list entries The List of Values Window contains a Find \ufb01eld (see \ufb01gure 4 on page 14) that can be used to search the list entries of the list of values matching entries: 1.

Organizational SDM Forms Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form can be selected from the menu Tools in the SDM Menubar and from other SDM forms (refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for details). It provides facilities that allow you to create IDD \ufb01les for ASCII data import from the data of the Operational Database (ODB). FIGURE  35 Basic Structure of the Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form is composed of the following components: \u25a0 SDM Menubar \u25a0 Message Line \u25a0 Status Line These form components are common in all SDM forms. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding sections in chapter 3, section \u2019SDM Basics\u2019 on page 3 in this document. \u25a0 Detail Block This form component is described in detail in the following section. SDM Menubar Message Line Status Line Detail Block Organizational SDM Forms Detail Block The Detail Block of the Reverse Transfer Form provides the following attributes: \u25a0 Subsystem Radiobuttons for selection of the subsystem: \u2013 SCADA \u2013 TCI \u2013 Elcom \u2013 ICCP \u2013 NA \u2013 DT \u2013 Type \u2013 Control Data \u25a0 Hierarchy Name Radiobuttons for selection of B1 or Application Data or Connection (if B1 or Application Data is selected, then a \ufb01eld for input of a B1 name is provided). These radiobuttons are only provided, if subsystem SCADA has been selected.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record de\ufb01nitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section \u2019Data Collection Guidelines\u2019 on page 297 and section \u2019General Format Guidelines\u2019 on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: \u25a0 AD_INFO \u25a0 AD_REFERENCE \u25a0 SCHEDULE \u25a0 AD_CALC_INFO \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_GROUP \u25a0 AD_CHARAC \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in \ufb01les. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions Throughout this document, the term \u201crecord\u201d is de\ufb01ned as a string of characters subdivided into data item \ufb01elds that are delimited by some record separator. Each \ufb01eld is used for the entry of data values for speci\ufb01c attributes of power system equipment and other entities. \u261e Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.", "B1 name, B2 name, B3 name, element name and info name are necessary. \u25a0 U If this checkbox is selected, it indicates that the condition can be unlocked by a com- mand from the operator during supervisory control.

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be con\ufb01gured as \u201ccalculated application data infos\u201d, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see \ufb01gure 61 on page 157). 2. Select the Calculation Worksheet by clicking the radio button Calculation in the work- sheet selection group of the Detail Block. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the Calculation Worksheet has already been selected in step 1. 3. Select the desired application data info from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the application data info has already been selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet in step 1. 4. SDM performs a query on the calculation attributes of the selected application data info. The available calculation attributes will be listed in the Operands Tabular List the of the Calculation Worksheet. 5. Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. \u261e Note: The desired formula must have been de\ufb01ned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speci\ufb01es the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2. Create a reference between a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference \u201cterminal\u201d in the column Ref- erence. 3.", "Apply your entry by pressing the Apply button or the OK button in the Command Block of the Application Data Info Form.

For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. \u261e Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section \u2019Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos\u2019 on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see \ufb01gure 61 on page 157). 2. Select the Calculation Worksheet by clicking the radio button Calculation in the work- sheet selection group of the Detail Block. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the Calculation Worksheet has already been selected in step 1. 3. Select the desired application data info from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. \u261e Note: This step may be omitted if the application data info has already been selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet in step 1. 4. SDM performs a query on the calculation attributes of the selected application data info. The available calculation attributes will be listed in the Operands Tabular List the of the Calculation Worksheet. 5. Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. \u261e Note: The desired formula must have been de\ufb01ned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speci\ufb01es the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.", "Enter the calculation operand data. For each operand, enter a unique operand identi\ufb01er into the concerned text \ufb01eld of the column Operand and a operand type into the concerned text \ufb01eld of the column Type in the Operands Tabular List or choose these information from the related lists of val- ues. \u261e Note: The required number of operands and the individual operand types depend on the used formula. Be aware that some operand types might not be applicable for an oper- and of a certain formula. The ability to enter values for the attributes Constant and B1-Name ... Info-Name also depends on the operand type. \u261e Note: For detailed information on the text \ufb01elds of the Calculation Worksheet, their relations and dependencies, refer to the subsequent section \u2019Calculation Worksheet\u2019 on page 167. Calculation Worksheet Clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group selects the Calculation Worksheet in the worksheet block. Application Data Forms FIGURE  64 Calculation Worksheet The Calculation Worksheet consists of the Result Block and the Operands Tabular List. Each line of the tabular list of operands contains the attribute settings of one single calcu- lation operand. The column Operand shows the name of the respective calculation oper- and, the columns Type, Constant, and B1-Name ... Info-Name contain the attribute set- tings of the respective calculation operand. Result Block \u25a0 Info Name A pop-list that contains the names of the available application data infos. The list item shows the name of the selected application data info. Another application data info may be selected from this pop-list at any time. \u261e Note: The pop-list Info Name contains only calculated application data infos, i.e., application data infos whose input mode has been set to SDM (see input mode description on page 161 for further details). The number of the contained application data infos is not af- fected by the selected worksheet view (see description of the Worksheet View Selec- tion Pop-List in the section \u2019Worksheet View Selection Pop-List\u2019 on page 159 in this document). \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Formula Contains the name of the assigned calculation formula. Result Block Operands Tabular List Application Data Forms \u261e Note: The formula assignment can only be modi\ufb01ed if no operand has been speci\ufb01ed (i.e., the Operands Tabular List is empty). After a calculation formula has been selected and at least one calculation operand has been speci\ufb01ed, the text \ufb01eld of the attribute For- mula will be protected and the assigned formula cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A calculation formula can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available calculation formula into the text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formula or by selecting a formula name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld of the attribute Formu- la. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those formulae whose result data type corresponds to the data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the main info value of the selected application data info is a boolean value, the list of values shows only those formulae whose result is a boolean. Operands Tabular List \u25a0 Operand Contains the name of the respective calculation operand. A calculation operand can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the operand\u2019s name into the re- spective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand or by selecting an operand name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Operand. \u261e Note: The number of calculation operands is pre-de\ufb01ned and may vary depending on the se- lected formula. The list of values shows only those calculation operands that are re- quired for the calculation of the selected formula. If all required calculation operands have been speci\ufb01ed, the de\ufb01nition of further calcu- lation operands will be rejected. An appropriate system message will appear. \u25a0 Type Contains the operand type. The operand type speci\ufb01es whether the value of the oper- and is a constant or is taken from a separate info speci\ufb01ed by a technological address. In the latter case, the attribute setting also speci\ufb01es whether the value must negated or not. The operand type can be speci\ufb01ed by entering the name of the operand type into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type or by selecting an operand type name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Type. \u261e Note: Application Data Forms The possibility to use a certain operand type for the respective operand depends on the de\ufb01nition of the selected formula.", "Opens the \ufb01gure group/text group window. \u261e Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is con\ufb01gured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section \u2019Additional Information Windows\u2019 on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  \u2019Handling of Additional Information\u2019 on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. \u25a0 AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u25a0 Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the con\ufb01gured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- \ufb01gured: \u2013 SDM Info value can be entered or modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. \u2013 UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modi\ufb01ed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modi\ufb01cations become effective immediately. \u2013 IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  \u2019Additional Information Window Button\u2019 on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is con\ufb01gured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speci\ufb01ed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM. \u261e Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM at any time only, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modi\ufb01ed via SDM, if \u2013 input mode is SDM and application data type speci\ufb01es a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms \u2013 input mode is UI and a value has been entered already \u2013 input mode is IO \u25a0 Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display \ufb01eld. \u261e Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system\u2019s con\ufb01guration phase and cannot be modi\ufb01ed via SDM at a later time. \u25a0 Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text \ufb01eld in the column Schedule. \u261e Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. \u25a0 Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references de\ufb01ne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference \u201cterminals\u201d that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  \u2019Application Data Reference Worksheet\u2019 on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section \u2019List Available Application Data References\u2019 above. 2. Create a reference between a reference \u201cterminal\u201d of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference \u201cterminal\u201d in the column Ref- erence. 3.", "5. Modify the selected attribute. Enter the new attribute value into the selected text \ufb01eld or double-click on the con- cerned text \ufb01eld to open a list of values and choose the desired value from the list of values. \u261e Note: Be aware that some attributes cannot be modi\ufb01ed. A possible reason for this behavior may be the setting of the Worksheet View Selection Pop-List (see description on page 159). For further information on application data info attributes and the associated text \ufb01elds, refer to the subsequent section \u2019Application Data Info Worksheet\u2019 on page 159. Modi\ufb01cations of additional information associated with application data infos are pos- sible, too.

Direct TAs Worksheet In this worksheet you can directly insert or delete a technological address (a modi\ufb01cation is not possible). The \ufb01ve parameters specify the technological address of a \ufb01lter entry, i.e., the technological address of a data entry that will be stored. Operating of the parameters Elem and Info is subject to the following restrictions: \u25a0 For value archives, only elements with the appropriate standard element type (pre-de- \ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition) may be selected or entered. Element speci\ufb01cations without the appropriate standard element type are automatically replaced by the \ufb01rst element found in the database having the pre-de\ufb01ned standard element type. Also, the input \ufb01eld for the parameter Info is locked as this parameter is pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition. For message archives, this input \ufb01eld is released. The standard element type and info pre-de\ufb01ned during archive de\ufb01nition are displayed in the Master Block. \u25a0 In case of special value archives, the input \ufb01eld of the parameter Info is operable only if the parameter Info has been marked as irrelevant during archive de\ufb01nition (usage of the wildcard symbol). If the parameters Standard Element and Info have not been marked as irrelevant dur- ing archive de\ufb01nition (usage of a valid standard element and/or info), they are subject to the restrictions described for regular value archives (see previous bullet). Filter TAs Worksheet In this worksheet the TA Table displays all technological addresses matching the criteria en- tered in the Filter De\ufb01nition Block.", "---> e.g., substation, line \u25a0 B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level \u25a0 B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data De\ufb01nition (IDD) is con\ufb01gured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated \ufb01lltab \ufb01les located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data de\ufb01nition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record de\ufb01nitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section \u2019Data Collection Guidelines\u2019 on page 297 and section \u2019General Format Guidelines\u2019 on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: \u25a0 AD_INFO \u25a0 AD_REFERENCE \u25a0 SCHEDULE \u25a0 AD_CALC_INFO \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_GROUP \u25a0 AD_CHARAC \u25a0 AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in \ufb01les. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions Throughout this document, the term \u201crecord\u201d is de\ufb01ned as a string of characters subdivided into data item \ufb01elds that are delimited by some record separator. Each \ufb01eld is used for the entry of data values for speci\ufb01c attributes of power system equipment and other entities. \u261e Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.", "6. Paste the technological addresses from the internal clipboard into the currently select- ed data record of your SDM form by pressing the button Paste in the SDM Toolbar of the respective SDM form. \u261e Note: If the cursor is currently located in a tabular list and you are going to paste several technological addresses, the technological addresses will be inserted in the appropri- ate columns of successive rows in the list. For example: Let\u2019s assume your SDM form contains a tabular list with columns repre- senting a technological address. Your cursor is currently located in the \ufb01rst row of this list. Now, you perform a query using the Query Window and you copy and paste 3 technological addresses. The \ufb01rst technological address will be inserted into the ap- propriate columns of the row where the cursor is located, the second technological ad- dress in the appropriate columns of the next row, and so on. The List Of Values (LOV) Feature Any attribute of a data entity may have an associated static list of valid values. This list may either be de\ufb01ned in the concerned database table of the source database or may be estab- lished for the concerned form component during the form creation. SDM Basics SDM forms support these lists by the List Of Values (LOV) feature. A list of values is a scrol- lable list in a separate window that pops up if you double-click on an input \ufb01eld that has an assigned list of valid values (for an example, see \ufb01gure 4 on page 14). List of Values Window The List of Values Window contains a scrollable pick list that shows a list of single-column or multi-column entries from which you can select a single, distinct value (in case of sin- gle-column entries) or a set of values (in case of multi-column entries). The list entries cor- respond to columns in a database table or to static values that have been established during the form creation (see \ufb01rst paragraph of the section \u2019The List Of Values (LOV) Feature\u2019 above). FIGURE  4 Example of a List of Values Window A list of values appears as a modal window which can be moved and resized. It contains the following components: \u25a0 Find \ufb01eld The Find \ufb01eld can be used to search speci\ufb01c list entries (refer to the section \u2019Search- ing speci\ufb01c list entries\u2019 on page 15 for further details). \u25a0 List panel The List panel shows the LOV entries (single-column entries or multi-column entries).

Organizational SDM Forms Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form can be selected from the menu Tools in the SDM Menubar and from other SDM forms (refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for details). It provides facilities that allow you to create IDD \ufb01les for ASCII data import from the data of the Operational Database (ODB). FIGURE  35 Basic Structure of the Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form is composed of the following components: \u25a0 SDM Menubar \u25a0 Message Line \u25a0 Status Line These form components are common in all SDM forms.

The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identi\ufb01cation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identi\ufb01er, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. \u261e Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speci\ufb01c data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter The \ufb01rst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- \ufb01nes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the de\ufb01nition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section \u2019Auto Creation of Element and Info Records\u2019 below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are de\ufb01ned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to de\ufb01ne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- \ufb01ned/satis\ufb01ed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. \u261e Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for \ufb01nding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 \u2019Applicable documents\u2019 on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the de\ufb01nition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. \u261e Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data de\ufb01nition (IDD) \ufb01le, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). \u261e Note: Base Applications Import Data De\ufb01nitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer.
