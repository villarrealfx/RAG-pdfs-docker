      "SDM Basics This chapter deals with basic SDM principles. It describes the following major aspects of SDM: ■ Basic concepts and operation procedures that apply to all SDM forms ■ The basic structure of the SDM forms SDM Basics Before you can go into the details of speciﬁc SDM forms, it is necessary to know the basic principles, features and operation procedures that are common to all SDM forms. The knowledge of these basics will help you to improve your understanding of the following chapters dealing with details of speciﬁc SDM forms. ☞ Note: The following detailed SDM form descriptions will presuppose knowledge of the basic SDM principles, features and operation procedures. Job Management The method by which database changes are grouped and controlled is called Job Manage- ment. It applies to SDM forms just as it would to any other data changing process. In order to modify data, you must be connected to a legitimate job that is in status Ready. To connect to a job, i.e., to resume an existing job or to create a new job, enter the job name into the text ﬁeld of the attribute Job Name in the Job Management Form. Other actions related with job management are performed via the Job Log Form. For further details on SDM Basics these forms, refer to the sections ’Job Management Form’ on page 34 and ’Job Log Form’ on page 50. You will not be able to insert, update and delete data via a SDM form, if you are not con- nected to a job or if you are connected to an unavailable job. In this case, the rights to insert, update and delete data will be disabled for the respective SDM form. In other words, you will solely have a read-only access to the concerned data. Job Interlocks Job interlocks prevent different jobs from modifying the same data by locking the data the jobs uses. This means that you cannot modify data which are locked by another job and other jobs cannot modify data your job has locked. Job interlocks are enforced in two ways depending on the hierarchical level of the data to be modiﬁed: ■ For entire forms This type of job interlock is enforced for data entities on a lower hierarchical level of a data hierarchy (for example: Elem is the 4th hierarchical level of the SCADA data hier- archy B1/B2/B3/Elem/Info, etc.). A job interlock may exist for all attributes of all data records shown in the respective form. The job interlock information is shown in the dis- play ﬁeld of the attribute Job Interlock in the Job Block of the respective form. For example: if you intend to modify an element record (identiﬁed by a particular tech- nological identiﬁer composed of B1, B2, B3 and Element Names) and another opera- tor already modiﬁes a B1, B2 or B3 data record involved in the technological identiﬁer of your element record, a job interlock on your Element Form will exist. You will not be able to apply modiﬁcations on any attribute of your element record as long as the job interlock exists. ■ For individual data records shown in a form This type of job interlock is enforced for top-level data entities (for example: B1 is the top-level data entity of the SCADA data hierarchy B1/B2/B3/Elem/Info, etc.). Different job interlocks may exist for different data records shown in the respective form. The job interlock information is associated with the concerned data record. Usually, the re- spective form contains a tabular list that shows the available data records. In this case, the job interlock information is shown in a separate column of this list. For example: if you intend to modify B1 blocks via the B1 Form, you might notice, that the tabular list contains a column Job Interlock that shows the job interlocks for the available B1 records. In either case, the following rule applies: If the value in the job interlock ﬁeld is zero (blank), you can perform your data modiﬁcation. If the concerned data are locked by another job, the name of the job that “holds” the inter- lock will appear in the job interlock ﬁeld. SDM Basics To view a job’s interlock history and other pertinent job interlock information, use the Job Interlock Form. For more details on this form, refer to the section ’Job Interlock Form’ on page 57. Validation Every attempt is made to validate data at the earliest possible moment. If a data entity can be veriﬁed at the item level, it is automatically veriﬁed. If data can only be veriﬁed within the context of an entire record, the validation will occur at the record level. If veriﬁcation of data requires that a number of records be completed or that an entire set of data be in place, validation will occur during Global Validation. Item Level Validation Simple data checks of single attributes will occur at the item level. If you modify an attribute so that its new value exceeds the attribute’s value range or if you enter a value that is not in the attribute’s list of valid values, SDM will notify you that the attribute value is not valid. If validation fails, the cursor is moved back into the input ﬁeld of the invalid attribute and an error message will appear in the window message line of the respective SDM form. It is rec- ommended that you correct the error before you continue. However, if this is one of those cases where the entered value shall violate the validation rule, you may ignore the error message and continue. The error will not be indicated a second time. Although SDM will not bother you with error messages beyond the ﬁrst message, an error message for each uncorrected attribute will be stored in the error message table when you ﬁnally commit your changes (for further information on this topic, refer to the section ’Error Messages’ on page 6 in this chapter). Record Level Validation Data checks that require the comparison of two or more attributes within a data record will be performed at the record level. Errors will be indicated if you move the cursor out of the modiﬁed data record. If validation fails, an alert window will appear. This alert window offers you the following op- tions: “Fix Data Errors” or “Skip Validation”. It is recommended that you correct the error be- fore you continue. However, if this is one of those cases where the entered value shall vio- late the validation rule, you may ignore the error message and continue. The error will not be indicated a second time. Although SDM will not bother you with error messages beyond the ﬁrst message, an error message for each uncorrected attribute will be stored in the error message table when you ﬁnally commit your changes (for further information on this topic, refer to the section ’Error Messages’ on page 6 in this chapter). SDM Basics Global Validation Global Validation compares data between similar data records, between different types of data records, and between data records of various data hierarchies. By its nature, Global Validation requires that you have the data in a stable state before you perform it. Global Val- idation can be performed whenever you complete a data editing session and is enforced before you attempt to perform a job transfer. Hints Hints are short messages describing data attributes. They will appear in the window mes- sage line of an SDM form after a mouseclick on the input ﬁeld of an attribute shown in the respective form. Hints are generated from the domain information deﬁned for the respective column in the concerned source database table. A hint will be displayed only if the message that was previously shown in the window mes- sage line was blank or another hint. If the previous message was an error message, the hint will not be displayed. Sometimes, when you move the cursor to the input ﬁeld of another attribute after an error message has been displayed, the hint related with the currently se- lected attribute will not be displayed. If you want the hint to be displayed, click on the input ﬁeld of a another attribute and then click on the input ﬁeld of the desired attribute again. Error Messages Ignoring error messages if they initially appear will not cause a loss of data. All error mes- sages are written into the corresponding source database message table when the data modiﬁcations are applied to the database. Depending on the current situation, error mes- sages will be displayed in the window message line of the respective SDM form or in a sep- arately opened alert window. If errors occur during the apply transaction of data modiﬁcations, an alert window will be displayed indicating the number of error messages that have been stored in the correspond- ing source database message table. If you press the button MSG in the SDM Toolbar imme- diately after you have acknowledged this message, the Error Message Form will appear and will show the ﬁrst error of those error messages. Queries If you select an SDM form, it will automatically come up with a full set of data if valid preset values have been provided in the Job Management Form. In this case, the logic behind the form is able to perform an automatic query on the requested data based on the provided preset values. However, if no preset values have been speciﬁed in the Job Management Form or if the speciﬁed preset values are invalid, the form comes up empty and will auto- matically switch to Query Mode. This means, the ﬁrst action you must perform before you can work with the respective SDM form must be a query to retrieve data to work with. SDM Basics Even if your preset values are correct and the SDM form has come up with a full set of data, you may perform a new query to retrieve another set of data to work with. Query Mode If no preset values have been speciﬁed in the Job Management Form or if the speciﬁed pre- set values are invalid, a selected SDM form comes up empty and switches automatically to Query Mode. Query Mode can be recognized by an appropriate system message that appears in the win- dow status line of the respective SDM form (see ﬁgure 1 below), by the status of the SDM Toolbar (all buttons of the SDM Toolbar, except the button Query, are disabled) and the con- tent of the input ﬁelds of the concerned SDM form (when entering Query Mode, the input ﬁelds are emptied). FIGURE  1 Indication of Query Mode in the Status Line of the respective SDM form If the SDM form you have selected comes up in Query Mode, you must perform a query before you can perform your intended data modiﬁcations. Detailed information on how to perform a query can be obtained from the section ’Performing a Query’ on page 11 in this chapter. ☞ Note: If the selected SDM form is in Query Mode and a query has not been performed, any operation that is not involved in performing a query will be rejected and an appropriate system message will appear in the window message line of the respective SDM form. Even if you can obviously enter data into the text ﬁelds of the respective SDM form, you will not be able to store these entries in the database since the buttons of the Com- mand Block are disabled. After you have performed a query, Query Mode is terminated automatically. If your SDM form is currently not in Query Mode and you want to perform a query, you must invoke Query Mode and then you can enter the Query Criteria and perform your query. For more details on how to perform a query, refer to the section ’Performing a Query’ below. Query Mode can be cancelled (even without performing a query) by selecting Exit from the File menu in the SDM Menubar. After the Query Mode has been cancelled, the buttons of the SDM Toolbar and the buttons of the Command Block in your SDM form might be en- abled, if appropriate. Then, you can select another SDM form from menus of the SDM Menubar or you can enter new data into the empty form. ☞ Note: This system message indicates Query Mode SDM Basics If you enter new data into your empty form and you apply those data modiﬁcations by pressing the button Apply in the Command Block of your form, your data modiﬁcations will be applied to the source database and a query on all available data records of the respective data entity will be performed. Query Criteria Using the query feature, all available data records of a speciﬁc data entity or a subset of the available data records matching certain query criteria can be retrieved. The number of retrieved data records will be displayed in the Status Line of the respective SDM form. FIGURE  2 Number of retrieved data records indicated in the Status Line of the SDM form For the retrieval of a subset of the available data records that match certain criteria, the SDM forms provide the following possibilities to specify query criteria: ■ Retrieval of data records matching exact values You can retrieve speciﬁc data records by entering exact values for the query criteria. For example, if you enter Vienna into the text ﬁeld of the attribute B1-Name in the Master Block of the B3 Form and 220 into the text ﬁeld of the attribute B1-Name in the Master Block of the B3 Form, the query will select all records in which the B1-block name is Vienna and the B2-block name is 220. ■ Retrieval of data records matching a search patterns You can also retrieve data records that match a particular search pattern composed of a value (e.g., a character string) and the wildcard characters underscore (“_”) or per- centage (“%”) or a combination of both. The wildcard character “_” represents any single character. The wildcard character “%” represents any combination of characters (including no character). For example, the B1-block name Vienna would match both the search pattern Vienn_ and the search pattern Vie%. Query Window Besides Query Mode and the query facilities in the Master Block, SDM provides a particular window for the retrieval of technological addresses. This window is called “Query Window”. It allows you to perform a query on technological addresses via a convenient user interface. The retrieved technological addresses may be copied into an internal clipboard and then be taken over into a SDM form with a simple Copy and Paste-procedure. Figure 3 on page 9 (below) shows you the basic structure of the Query Window: Number of records retrieved by a query SDM Basics FIGURE  3 Structure of the Query Window ■ SDM Toolbar Besides the seven standard toolbar buttons (see section ’SDM Toolbar’ on page 21 for more details), the SDM Toolbar of the Query Window provides the following addi- tional buttons: – All Pressing this button selects all available technological addresses from the Query Result Tabular List. The check boxes of the selected technological addresses in the column Selected of the Query Result Tabular List are automatically checked. ☞ Note: The button All remains disabled until at least one technological address is available in the Query Result Tabular List. – Copy Filter Block Query Result Tabular List SDM Toolbar Command Block SDM Basics If you press the button Copy in the SDM Toolbar of the Query Window, the select- ed technological addresses from the Query Result Tabular List are copied to the internal clipboard. ☞ Note: The button Copy remains disabled until at least one technological address has been selected from the Query Result Tabular List. ■ Command Block Basically, the Command Block of the Query Window contains the same buttons as the standard Command Block in a SDM form (see section ’Command Block’ on page 26 for more details). ☞ Note: The buttons OK and Apply remain disabled. – OK – Apply – Cancel Pressing the button Cancel button closes the Query Window. ■ Filter Block – B1-Name – B2-Name – B3-Name – Element Name The text ﬁelds of these 4 attributes can be used to enter the query criteria (search pattern). SDM Basics ☞ Note: Unlike the other query facilities, characters such as “%” or “_” will not be considered as wildcard characters (see section ’Query Criteria’ on page 8 for more details on wild- card characters). – Selected Shows the number of the currently selected technological addresses from the Query Result Tabular List.",
      "The only way to change its value, once the record has been created, is to delete the record and all subordinate records (cascade delete) and reinsert the record with the new value. The one exception to this rule is that the field may be updated at any time prior to its first transfer to the operational database. That is, the initial value is updateable from its initial entry into the database until it is transferred into the on-line copy of the operational database. Once the info is part of the on-line database, it can no longer be updated in the conventional manner.

Fur- ther details on the Duplicate feature can be obtained from the description of the button Du- plicate on page 24. SDM Basics The Basic Structure of SDM Forms All SDM forms are composed of the same basic form components. This common standard- ized structure supports the operator in becoming familiar with the SDM forms. However, de- pending on the form’s intended purpose certain SDM forms will not need some of the com- ponents provided by the common structure and the structure of other SDM forms will slight- ly deviate from this standard. Those differences are indicated in the subsequent SDM form descriptions. The following ﬁgure 5 shows you the standardized form components using the Application Data Info Form as an example. FIGURE  5 Basic Structure of a SDM form Each SDM form is composed of the following form components: ■ SDM Menubar SDM Toolbar SDM Menubar Job Block Command Block Detail Block Message Line Master Block Status Line SDM Basics ■ SDM Toolbar ■ Job Block ■ Master Block (optional) ■ Command Block ■ Detail Block ■ Message Line ■ Status Line SDM Menubar Each SDM form provides a menu bar (the “SDM Menubar”), which is located at the top of an SDM form and runs across the entire SDM form (see ﬁgure 6 below). FIGURE  6 SDM Menubar The SDM Menubar contains the following menus: ■ File The File menu provides form-related actions. For example: Exit from form. ■ Job Use the Job menu to select organizational SDM forms dealing with job and task man- agement, such as Job Management Form, Job Log Form, Job Trace Form, Job Inter- lock Form, etc. ■ Tools Perform various SDM actions by selecting organizational SDM forms like the Model Form, Reverse Transfer Form, etc. ■ Reports Create application-speciﬁc reports by selecting the appropriate form via the Reports menu. ■ Help Get online help Information by selecting the appropriate help topic from the Help menu. The following menus can be used to access application-speciﬁc SDM forms: ■ SCADA SDM Menubar SDM Basics ■ AD ■ TCI ■ ELCOM ■ ICCP ■ NA ■ DMS ■ Graphic SDM Toolbar The SDM Toolbar is a row of buttons located beneath the SDM Menubar and provides fast access to important SDM features, e.g., creating, editing or deleting a data record, etc. (for an example of a SDM Toolbar, see ﬁgure 7 below). FIGURE  7 Example of a SDM Toolbar The standard SDM Toolbar provides seven buttons (see description below). These buttons are available in each application-speciﬁc SDM form. ☞ Note: Other buttons may be available depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation. Depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation, some of the provided buttons may be disabled. Buttons provided in the SDM Toolbar will be enabled or dis- abled dynamically. If more buttons are available than the eight buttons described below, refer to the de- scription of the concerned SDM form for more information on those buttons. The content of the SDM Toolbar in organizational SDM forms might deviate from the described SDM Toolbar conﬁguration. If so, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for more information on the speciﬁc SDM Toolbar. ■ Query If the concerned SDM form is already in Query Mode, pressing the button Query performs a query based on the entered Query Criteria. If the concerned SDM form was not in Query Mode, pressing the button Query puts the form into Query Mode. SDM Toolbar SDM Basics For more details on the Query Mode and queries, refer to the section ’Queries’ on page 6. ■ ExitQuery If the concerned SDM form is in Query Mode, pressing the button ExitQuery leaves the Query Mode without performing a query. ■ Insert Insert new (empty) data record. Pressing the button Insert creates a new data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, a new blank row is inserted into the list beneath that row where cursor is located. ☞ Note: Insert creates a new record, but does not store it. If you want to store the new data record, press the button OK or the button Apply in the Command Block of the con- cerned SDM form. For more details on the Command Block, refer to the section ’Com- mand Block’ on page 26. In case the button Insert is disabled you are currently not allowed to insert a new data record. ■ Delete Remove one or more data records from the database. Pressing the button Delete removes the currently selected data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) is removed. ☞ Note: You will not be allowed to remove a data record if there are pending data modiﬁcations on any attribute of the concerned data record. If the SDM form detects uncommitted data modiﬁcations it will request you to commit those modiﬁcations or to perform a roll- back on those modiﬁcations before you can proceed with your deletion. If the data record to be removed has associated data records in other database tables (so-called “Child Records”), those data records will also be removed. This is called ”Cascading Delete”. For example, if you remove an application data characteristic group record, this data record may have associated application data characteristic records and these may have associated characteristic segment records. If you press the button Delete to remove the application data characteristic group record all associ- ated application data characteristic records and all associated characteristic segment records will also be removed. If the data record you are about to remove has associated child records, an alert win- dow will pop up informing you that a cascading delete will be performed. At this point you can cancel the deletion or continue it by pressing the appropriate button in the alert window. ☞ Note: SDM Basics Sometimes you may encounter a long waiting time while a delete transaction is per- formed. This will especially be the case if a deletion is performed which removes a large amount of data from the database (e.g., in case of a cascading delete). Since a lot of activity takes place beneath the surface in such a case, we recommend that you break such transactions down into several smaller transactions. For example, when re- moving a large B1 block, it would be better, to delete each B2 block individually rather than to delete the entire B1 block at once. An attempt to perform a delete transaction which is too large to delete may cause an errors, especially if the system is rather busy. Deletions will automatically change the database. Once a deletion is initiated, it cannot be rolled back. To reverse the effects of a deletion, use the Cancel Task feature in the Task Log Form (see section  ’Task Log Form’ on page 60 for more details on this topic). No speciﬁc alert window will appear if a cascading delete removes child data records used in other source database tables. The inconsistency that occurs in such a case will be detected during a global validation. ■ Defaults Assign pre-deﬁned default values to the attributes of the currently selected data record. Columns of a source database table may have associated default values which are also deﬁned in the source database. If default values are available for the selected data record, the current attribute values will be replaced by the speciﬁed default values after you have pressed the button Defaults. ☞ Note: If no default values are available for the selected data record, the button Defaults will be disabled. If you intend to use default values on a data record, we recommend to use the Defaults feature before you enter any other information for this data record, since default values will overwrite all related items you have already entered for this data record. ■ Clear Remove the content of the input ﬁelds of the selected data record. If you press the button Clear, the content of all input ﬁelds of the currently selected data record will be emptied. The content of these ﬁelds will also be removed from the work space (for more information on the work space, refer tot the section ’Applying Trans- actions’ on page 17). ☞ Note: Unlike Delete (see description on page 22), pressing the button Clear will not remove the concerned data record from the database. SDM Basics If you did not apply your data modiﬁcations on the currently selected data record yet, and you have pressed the button Clear, the entire data record will be removed. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be removed. ■ Duplicate Duplicate the preceding data record and insert this copy as a new data record. If you press the button Duplicate, a copy of the preceding data record will be inserted as a new data record. ☞ Note: Attributes that require unique information will not be copied and the concerned input ﬁelds in the new data record will be left blank. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be copied and in- serted as a new row below the selected row. ■ MSG Open the Error Message Form. Pressing the button MSG opens the Error Message Form that shows the error messag- es of the job you are currently connected to. For a detailed description of the informa- tion displayed in the Error Message Form, refer to the section ’Error Message Form’ on page 72. ■ Longhint Display a long hint text. Move the cursor to the input ﬁeld of an attribute and press the button Longhint. Then, the long hint associated with the respective attribute will be displayed in the Message Line of the respective SDM form. ☞ Note: Just like “short” hints (see section ’Hints’ on page 6 for details), long hints must be de- ﬁned in the source database table where the concerned attribute is deﬁned. If no long hint is available for the respective attribute, the button Longhint will be dis- abled. The accessibility of the button Longhint may change every time you move the cursor to another input ﬁeld depending on the availability of a long hint in the con- cerned source database table. Job Block The Job Block is located in the upper left corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains display ﬁelds showing job information and job interlock information. SDM Basics FIGURE  8 Example of a Job Block ■ Job Shows the name of the job accessing the respective SDM form. ■ Job Interlock If a job interlock for the entire SDM form exists, the display ﬁeld of the attribute Job Interlock shows the name of the locking job. ☞ Note: Depending on the hierarchical level of the data presented by the form, this attribute might not appear. For more details on job interlocks, refer to the section ’Job Inter- locks’ on page 4. Master Block The Master Block is an optional form component. Its availability in a SDM form depends on the form’s intended purpose and the hierarchical level of the data presented by the respec- tive SDM form. The Master Block provides attributes representing the primary database keys of the con- cerned data object. The input ﬁelds of the provided attributes are used to enter query crite- ria when performing a query. ☞ Note: Before you can use the Master Block, you must switch to Query Mode. For more de- tails on the Query Mode, refer to the section  ’Query Mode’ on page 7. For detailed information on the availability of a master block in a speciﬁc SDM form and its content, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form. Job SDM Basics FIGURE  9 Example of a Master Block Command Block The command block is located in the upper right corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains the following buttons to apply and discard data modiﬁcations per- formed in the SDM form: ■ OK Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database and exits the concerned SDM form. ■ Apply Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database. The concerned SDM form remains and further data modiﬁcations can be performed. ■ Cancel Dismisses the performed data modiﬁcations. The data modiﬁcations will not be ap- plied to the database.",
      "For more de- tails on the Query Mode, refer to the section  ’Query Mode’ on page 7. SDM Toolbar In addition to the standard toolbar buttons described in section ’The Basic Structure of SDM Forms’ on page 19 in this document, the SDM Toolbar of the Archive Filter Form con- tains the following button: ■ Update When this button is pressed, all TAs matching the ﬁlter criteria deﬁned in the Filter Def- inition Block are entered into the TA Table of the Filter TAs Worksheet. Filter Deﬁnition Block ■ Filter Name In this line a name for the ﬁlter can be entered. The following two lines serve for the deﬁnition of ﬁlter criteria that are used to determine a number of appropriate technological addresses for the TA Table. These technological ad- dresses are visible in the TA Table when the Filter TAs Worksheet is selected. For updating the TA Table after the ﬁlter deﬁnition has been changed, press button Update. Address syntax speciﬁcations may consist both of block names (substation names, feeder names, etc.) and block type names. For each parameter of both lines, the wildcard symbol (“*”) may be used. Usage of a wild- card symbol means that the technological addresses must be determined with all available network image entries of the respective parameter. The explicitly speciﬁed parameters re- main unchanged. Archive Filter Form The mixed usage of both input lines and usage of the wildcard symbol is subject to the fol- lowing restrictions: ■ Usage of a wildcard symbol for the parameter B1 is not possible and will be rejected. ■ Inputs in ﬁelds located one below the other are mutually exclusive. Direct TA Input ■ B1-Name ■ B2-Name ■ B3-Name ■ Element-Name ■ Info-Name In this line only block names may be speciﬁed. Typiﬁed TA Input ■ Block-Type (B1) ■ Block-Type (B2) ■ Block-Type (B3) ■ Element-Type ■ Info-Type In this line only block type names are allowed. Worksheet Selection Group The Worksheet Selection Group contains two radiobuttons for selecting either the Direct TAs Worksheet or the Filter TAs Worksheet. TA Table The TA Table consists of the following columns: ■ B1-Name ■ B2-Name ■ B3-Name ■ Element-Name Archive Filter Form ■ Info-Name ■ Job Interlock The content of the TA Table depends on the selected worksheet. Direct TAs Worksheet In this worksheet you can directly insert or delete a technological address (a modiﬁcation is not possible). The ﬁve parameters specify the technological address of a ﬁlter entry, i.e., the technological address of a data entry that will be stored. Operating of the parameters Elem and Info is subject to the following restrictions: ■ For value archives, only elements with the appropriate standard element type (pre-de- ﬁned during archive deﬁnition) may be selected or entered. Element speciﬁcations without the appropriate standard element type are automatically replaced by the ﬁrst element found in the database having the pre-deﬁned standard element type. Also, the input ﬁeld for the parameter Info is locked as this parameter is pre-deﬁned during archive deﬁnition. For message archives, this input ﬁeld is released. The standard element type and info pre-deﬁned during archive deﬁnition are displayed in the Master Block. ■ In case of special value archives, the input ﬁeld of the parameter Info is operable only if the parameter Info has been marked as irrelevant during archive deﬁnition (usage of the wildcard symbol). If the parameters Standard Element and Info have not been marked as irrelevant dur- ing archive deﬁnition (usage of a valid standard element and/or info), they are subject to the restrictions described for regular value archives (see previous bullet). Filter TAs Worksheet In this worksheet the TA Table displays all technological addresses matching the criteria en- tered in the Filter Deﬁnition Block.",
      "For more information on the buttons of the Command Block, refer to the section ’Command Block’ on page 26. Clear This feature allows you to empty the input ﬁelds of a data record. To clear the input ﬁelds of a data record, simply press the button Clear in the SDM Toolbar. For more information on this feature, refer to the description of the button Clear on page 23. Obtaining Information on Error Messages If you perform a transaction (e.g., a data modiﬁcation) and an error occurs, a message in- dicating the occurrence of an error will appear in the Message Line of the respective SDM forms. For detailed information on the concerned error, select the Help menu from the SDM Menubar and click on the Error choice. This menu choice will display error information and/or detailed help information for the item that caused the last error. The Model Feature SDM provides a model feature that allows you to copy an entire data hierarchy and to insert it as a new data hierarchy into the source database. Unlike the Duplicate feature which is used to create and insert a copy of a single data record, the model feature copies all data records of the selected data hierarchy and inserts these data records as a new data hierarchy into the source database. For example: the model feature allows to create a new B1 block (e.g., a new substation) as a copy of an existing B1 block. All subordinate data entities of the B1 block model (all B2-da- ta records, B3-date records, etc.) will be copied and inserted automatically. The model feature is performed via the Model Form.",
      "■ Job ID This ﬁeld displays the number used for identifying the speciﬁed job. Organizational SDM Forms Command Block The Command Block contains the following buttons: ■ Cancel Exits the Task Log Form. If you press this button, the Task Log Form will be closed and the Job Management Form will appear. ■ Cancel Last Task This button allows you to cancel the most recently completed task, thereby removing any data changes made by that task from the database. You can cancel all of the tasks associated with a job, but each task must be cancelled individually and in the reverse order of how it was performed. ■ Clear Task Errors This function clears the errors for the selected task in the Task Information Block and sets the error number in the Errors ﬁeld to zero. ■ Clear Job Errors This function clears the errors for all tasks of the speciﬁed job. ■ Clear Task Trace This function clears the trace messages for the selected task in the Task Information Block. ■ Clear Job Trace This function clears the trace messages for all tasks of the speciﬁed job. Task Information Block The following parameters are shown in the Task Information Block: ■ Task ID This is a chronological number to record the tasks performed. ■ Task Name It is the name of a particular task. This name is generated automatically by the system according to the speciﬁed task. ■ Creation This ﬁeld indicates the date and time for the creation of the task. ■ Creation Username Shows the username of the operator who has created the respective task. ■ Errors The number of errors appeared for the speciﬁed task. Organizational SDM Forms ■ Infos The number of informational messages appeared for the selected task. Organizational SDM Forms Task Error Log Form The Task Error Log Form allows you to view the chronology of the tasks containing errors for a particular job. The form can be selected under the menu Job in the SDM Menubar. Each task which contains errors and its identifying parameters are shown in one line of the Task Information Block. There is a scrollbar at the right side of the list to scroll the list, as there can be more tasks deﬁned than one page can show. FIGURE  33 Basic Structure of the Task Error Log Form This form is identically constructed as the Task Log Form. The difference is that only the tasks which involve errors are displayed and the Cancel Last Task button is always disabled. Toolbar of the Task Error Log Form SDM Menubar Connection Block Command Block Task Information Block Message Line Selection Block Status Line Organizational SDM Forms Model Form The Model Form can be selected from the menu Tools in the SDM Menubar and from other SDM forms (refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for details).

It describes the following major aspects of SDM: ■ Basic concepts and operation procedures that apply to all SDM forms ■ The basic structure of the SDM forms SDM Basics Before you can go into the details of speciﬁc SDM forms, it is necessary to know the basic principles, features and operation procedures that are common to all SDM forms. The knowledge of these basics will help you to improve your understanding of the following chapters dealing with details of speciﬁc SDM forms. ☞ Note: The following detailed SDM form descriptions will presuppose knowledge of the basic SDM principles, features and operation procedures. Job Management The method by which database changes are grouped and controlled is called Job Manage- ment. It applies to SDM forms just as it would to any other data changing process. In order to modify data, you must be connected to a legitimate job that is in status Ready. To connect to a job, i.e., to resume an existing job or to create a new job, enter the job name into the text ﬁeld of the attribute Job Name in the Job Management Form. Other actions related with job management are performed via the Job Log Form. For further details on SDM Basics these forms, refer to the sections ’Job Management Form’ on page 34 and ’Job Log Form’ on page 50. You will not be able to insert, update and delete data via a SDM form, if you are not con- nected to a job or if you are connected to an unavailable job. In this case, the rights to insert, update and delete data will be disabled for the respective SDM form. In other words, you will solely have a read-only access to the concerned data. Job Interlocks Job interlocks prevent different jobs from modifying the same data by locking the data the jobs uses. This means that you cannot modify data which are locked by another job and other jobs cannot modify data your job has locked. Job interlocks are enforced in two ways depending on the hierarchical level of the data to be modiﬁed: ■ For entire forms This type of job interlock is enforced for data entities on a lower hierarchical level of a data hierarchy (for example: Elem is the 4th hierarchical level of the SCADA data hier- archy B1/B2/B3/Elem/Info, etc.). A job interlock may exist for all attributes of all data records shown in the respective form. The job interlock information is shown in the dis- play ﬁeld of the attribute Job Interlock in the Job Block of the respective form. For example: if you intend to modify an element record (identiﬁed by a particular tech- nological identiﬁer composed of B1, B2, B3 and Element Names) and another opera- tor already modiﬁes a B1, B2 or B3 data record involved in the technological identiﬁer of your element record, a job interlock on your Element Form will exist. You will not be able to apply modiﬁcations on any attribute of your element record as long as the job interlock exists. ■ For individual data records shown in a form This type of job interlock is enforced for top-level data entities (for example: B1 is the top-level data entity of the SCADA data hierarchy B1/B2/B3/Elem/Info, etc.). Different job interlocks may exist for different data records shown in the respective form. The job interlock information is associated with the concerned data record. Usually, the re- spective form contains a tabular list that shows the available data records. In this case, the job interlock information is shown in a separate column of this list. For example: if you intend to modify B1 blocks via the B1 Form, you might notice, that the tabular list contains a column Job Interlock that shows the job interlocks for the available B1 records. In either case, the following rule applies: If the value in the job interlock ﬁeld is zero (blank), you can perform your data modiﬁcation. If the concerned data are locked by another job, the name of the job that “holds” the inter- lock will appear in the job interlock ﬁeld. SDM Basics To view a job’s interlock history and other pertinent job interlock information, use the Job Interlock Form. For more details on this form, refer to the section ’Job Interlock Form’ on page 57. Validation Every attempt is made to validate data at the earliest possible moment. If a data entity can be veriﬁed at the item level, it is automatically veriﬁed. If data can only be veriﬁed within the context of an entire record, the validation will occur at the record level. If veriﬁcation of data requires that a number of records be completed or that an entire set of data be in place, validation will occur during Global Validation. Item Level Validation Simple data checks of single attributes will occur at the item level. If you modify an attribute so that its new value exceeds the attribute’s value range or if you enter a value that is not in the attribute’s list of valid values, SDM will notify you that the attribute value is not valid. If validation fails, the cursor is moved back into the input ﬁeld of the invalid attribute and an error message will appear in the window message line of the respective SDM form. It is rec- ommended that you correct the error before you continue. However, if this is one of those cases where the entered value shall violate the validation rule, you may ignore the error message and continue. The error will not be indicated a second time. Although SDM will not bother you with error messages beyond the ﬁrst message, an error message for each uncorrected attribute will be stored in the error message table when you ﬁnally commit your changes (for further information on this topic, refer to the section ’Error Messages’ on page 6 in this chapter). Record Level Validation Data checks that require the comparison of two or more attributes within a data record will be performed at the record level. Errors will be indicated if you move the cursor out of the modiﬁed data record. If validation fails, an alert window will appear. This alert window offers you the following op- tions: “Fix Data Errors” or “Skip Validation”. It is recommended that you correct the error be- fore you continue. However, if this is one of those cases where the entered value shall vio- late the validation rule, you may ignore the error message and continue. The error will not be indicated a second time. Although SDM will not bother you with error messages beyond the ﬁrst message, an error message for each uncorrected attribute will be stored in the error message table when you ﬁnally commit your changes (for further information on this topic, refer to the section ’Error Messages’ on page 6 in this chapter). SDM Basics Global Validation Global Validation compares data between similar data records, between different types of data records, and between data records of various data hierarchies. By its nature, Global Validation requires that you have the data in a stable state before you perform it. Global Val- idation can be performed whenever you complete a data editing session and is enforced before you attempt to perform a job transfer. Hints Hints are short messages describing data attributes. They will appear in the window mes- sage line of an SDM form after a mouseclick on the input ﬁeld of an attribute shown in the respective form. Hints are generated from the domain information deﬁned for the respective column in the concerned source database table. A hint will be displayed only if the message that was previously shown in the window mes- sage line was blank or another hint. If the previous message was an error message, the hint will not be displayed. Sometimes, when you move the cursor to the input ﬁeld of another attribute after an error message has been displayed, the hint related with the currently se- lected attribute will not be displayed. If you want the hint to be displayed, click on the input ﬁeld of a another attribute and then click on the input ﬁeld of the desired attribute again. Error Messages Ignoring error messages if they initially appear will not cause a loss of data. All error mes- sages are written into the corresponding source database message table when the data modiﬁcations are applied to the database. Depending on the current situation, error mes- sages will be displayed in the window message line of the respective SDM form or in a sep- arately opened alert window. If errors occur during the apply transaction of data modiﬁcations, an alert window will be displayed indicating the number of error messages that have been stored in the correspond- ing source database message table. If you press the button MSG in the SDM Toolbar imme- diately after you have acknowledged this message, the Error Message Form will appear and will show the ﬁrst error of those error messages. Queries If you select an SDM form, it will automatically come up with a full set of data if valid preset values have been provided in the Job Management Form. In this case, the logic behind the form is able to perform an automatic query on the requested data based on the provided preset values. However, if no preset values have been speciﬁed in the Job Management Form or if the speciﬁed preset values are invalid, the form comes up empty and will auto- matically switch to Query Mode. This means, the ﬁrst action you must perform before you can work with the respective SDM form must be a query to retrieve data to work with. SDM Basics Even if your preset values are correct and the SDM form has come up with a full set of data, you may perform a new query to retrieve another set of data to work with. Query Mode If no preset values have been speciﬁed in the Job Management Form or if the speciﬁed pre- set values are invalid, a selected SDM form comes up empty and switches automatically to Query Mode. Query Mode can be recognized by an appropriate system message that appears in the win- dow status line of the respective SDM form (see ﬁgure 1 below), by the status of the SDM Toolbar (all buttons of the SDM Toolbar, except the button Query, are disabled) and the con- tent of the input ﬁelds of the concerned SDM form (when entering Query Mode, the input ﬁelds are emptied). FIGURE  1 Indication of Query Mode in the Status Line of the respective SDM form If the SDM form you have selected comes up in Query Mode, you must perform a query before you can perform your intended data modiﬁcations. Detailed information on how to perform a query can be obtained from the section ’Performing a Query’ on page 11 in this chapter. ☞ Note: If the selected SDM form is in Query Mode and a query has not been performed, any operation that is not involved in performing a query will be rejected and an appropriate system message will appear in the window message line of the respective SDM form. Even if you can obviously enter data into the text ﬁelds of the respective SDM form, you will not be able to store these entries in the database since the buttons of the Com- mand Block are disabled. After you have performed a query, Query Mode is terminated automatically. If your SDM form is currently not in Query Mode and you want to perform a query, you must invoke Query Mode and then you can enter the Query Criteria and perform your query. For more details on how to perform a query, refer to the section ’Performing a Query’ below. Query Mode can be cancelled (even without performing a query) by selecting Exit from the File menu in the SDM Menubar. After the Query Mode has been cancelled, the buttons of the SDM Toolbar and the buttons of the Command Block in your SDM form might be en- abled, if appropriate. Then, you can select another SDM form from menus of the SDM Menubar or you can enter new data into the empty form. ☞ Note: This system message indicates Query Mode SDM Basics If you enter new data into your empty form and you apply those data modiﬁcations by pressing the button Apply in the Command Block of your form, your data modiﬁcations will be applied to the source database and a query on all available data records of the respective data entity will be performed. Query Criteria Using the query feature, all available data records of a speciﬁc data entity or a subset of the available data records matching certain query criteria can be retrieved. The number of retrieved data records will be displayed in the Status Line of the respective SDM form. FIGURE  2 Number of retrieved data records indicated in the Status Line of the SDM form For the retrieval of a subset of the available data records that match certain criteria, the SDM forms provide the following possibilities to specify query criteria: ■ Retrieval of data records matching exact values You can retrieve speciﬁc data records by entering exact values for the query criteria. For example, if you enter Vienna into the text ﬁeld of the attribute B1-Name in the Master Block of the B3 Form and 220 into the text ﬁeld of the attribute B1-Name in the Master Block of the B3 Form, the query will select all records in which the B1-block name is Vienna and the B2-block name is 220. ■ Retrieval of data records matching a search patterns You can also retrieve data records that match a particular search pattern composed of a value (e.g., a character string) and the wildcard characters underscore (“_”) or per- centage (“%”) or a combination of both. The wildcard character “_” represents any single character. The wildcard character “%” represents any combination of characters (including no character). For example, the B1-block name Vienna would match both the search pattern Vienn_ and the search pattern Vie%. Query Window Besides Query Mode and the query facilities in the Master Block, SDM provides a particular window for the retrieval of technological addresses. This window is called “Query Window”. It allows you to perform a query on technological addresses via a convenient user interface. The retrieved technological addresses may be copied into an internal clipboard and then be taken over into a SDM form with a simple Copy and Paste-procedure. Figure 3 on page 9 (below) shows you the basic structure of the Query Window: Number of records retrieved by a query SDM Basics FIGURE  3 Structure of the Query Window ■ SDM Toolbar Besides the seven standard toolbar buttons (see section ’SDM Toolbar’ on page 21 for more details), the SDM Toolbar of the Query Window provides the following addi- tional buttons: – All Pressing this button selects all available technological addresses from the Query Result Tabular List. The check boxes of the selected technological addresses in the column Selected of the Query Result Tabular List are automatically checked. ☞ Note: The button All remains disabled until at least one technological address is available in the Query Result Tabular List. – Copy Filter Block Query Result Tabular List SDM Toolbar Command Block SDM Basics If you press the button Copy in the SDM Toolbar of the Query Window, the select- ed technological addresses from the Query Result Tabular List are copied to the internal clipboard. ☞ Note: The button Copy remains disabled until at least one technological address has been selected from the Query Result Tabular List. ■ Command Block Basically, the Command Block of the Query Window contains the same buttons as the standard Command Block in a SDM form (see section ’Command Block’ on page 26 for more details). ☞ Note: The buttons OK and Apply remain disabled. – OK – Apply – Cancel Pressing the button Cancel button closes the Query Window. ■ Filter Block – B1-Name – B2-Name – B3-Name – Element Name The text ﬁelds of these 4 attributes can be used to enter the query criteria (search pattern). SDM Basics ☞ Note: Unlike the other query facilities, characters such as “%” or “_” will not be considered as wildcard characters (see section ’Query Criteria’ on page 8 for more details on wild- card characters). – Selected Shows the number of the currently selected technological addresses from the Query Result Tabular List.",

The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identiﬁcation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identiﬁer, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. ☞ Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speciﬁc data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 ’Applicable documents’ on page 296 in this chapter The ﬁrst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- ﬁnes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section ’Auto Creation of Element and Info Records’ on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the deﬁnition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are deﬁned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section ’Auto Creation of Element and Info Records’ below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are deﬁned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to deﬁne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- ﬁned/satisﬁed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. ☞ Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for ﬁnding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 ’Applicable documents’ on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the deﬁnition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. ☞ Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data deﬁnition (IDD) ﬁle, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). ☞ Note: Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD ﬁle, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data Deﬁnition (IDD) is conﬁgured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated ﬁlltab ﬁles located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data deﬁnition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record deﬁnitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section ’Data Collection Guidelines’ on page 297 and section ’General Format Guidelines’ on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: ■ AD_INFO ■ AD_REFERENCE ■ SCHEDULE ■ AD_CALC_INFO ■ AD_CHARAC_GROUP ■ AD_CHARAC ■ AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in ﬁles. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions Throughout this document, the term “record” is deﬁned as a string of characters subdivided into data item ﬁelds that are delimited by some record separator. Each ﬁeld is used for the entry of data values for speciﬁc attributes of power system equipment and other entities. ☞ Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.",
      "Most, but not all, of the information needed to deﬁne the system is included within this chap- ter. Certain data, especially that which deals with conﬁguring the system, is enterable only through SDM, job ﬁles (i.e., BQ jobs) or as system parameters. This type of information must be conﬁgured into the system before the import data is imported into the system. Some examples of this type of data are: block types, element types, system sizing param- eters, formulae used in calculations, characteristic curves used to convert raw data to en- gineering units, etc. A complete understanding of the concerned data analysis user guide and completion of the SINAUT Spectrum SDM class will help you to understand the information that needs to be entered.

Command Block The Command Block contains the following buttons: ■ OK Enters into the database all changes made since the last ‘Apply’, exits the current form and returns to the place from which it was called. It is practically the combination of the buttons ‘Apply’ and ‘Cancel’. ■ Apply Enters into the database all changes made since the last ‘Apply’. ■ Cancel The Cancel function behaves differently, depending on what mode the form is in. If the form is in Normal mode, pressing ‘Cancel’ exits the current form and returns to the place from which it was called. ■ Fix Error Organizational SDM Forms As the name implies, the Fix Error button provides a handy way of navigating to the er- roneous data so that you can correct the problem. If you choose to ﬁx the data, be sure to delete the error message too. ■ Mark OK One of the features of the SDM database is the ability, in most cases, to override data constraints. And for those situations, when data deviates from the norm, the Mark OK button has to be used. Marking a message okay not only moves the message out of the error message table, it also turns off that error for that record for all times. Once an error is marked okay, it will never again be issued for that data record.

FIGURE  10 Command Block Master Block Command Block SDM Basics Detail Block The detail block of a SDM form contains all form components that are provided to perform the form’s intended purpose. The actual content of the detail block varies from SDM form to SDM form and may change dynamically depending on the operator’s interaction with SDM. For more details on the form components actually provided by the detail block, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form. Message Line Each SDM form contains a message line that is used to display hint texts (for more details, refer to the section ’Hints’ on page 6) and system messages. It is located at the bottom of the SDM form and reaches across the entire form. FIGURE  11 Message line Message Line SDM Basics Status Line Each SDM form contains a status line that is used to indicate modes and other status infor- mation. For example: the status line indicates form modes, such as Query Mode (see section ’Query Mode’ on page 7), character modes, e.g., insert characters or replace char- acters, the number of records retrieved by a query, etc. . FIGURE  12 Status line Scrollbars Scrollbars allow you to quickly navigate through a set of data records, e.g., in a tabular list. Scrollbars can be attached either horizontally or vertically. FIGURE  13 Example of a vertical scrollbar ☞ Note: The behavior of scrollbars in forms slightly deviates from the behavior of scrollbars you might be familiar with from other applications. The differences are described below. Status Line Number of records retrieved by a query Form mode Character mode Vertical scrollbar Scrollbar thumb Scrollbar alley SDM Basics As usual, the position of the scrollbar thumb in the scrollbar alley gives you a feedback of the relative position of the current data record within the respective set of data records (e.g., within a tabular list). The length of the scrollbar thumb will give you information on the num- ber of retrieved data records. However, since forms retrieve data records on a package basis, “set of data records” does not necessarily mean “all available data records”, but the set of data records that have been fetched so far. This may or may not include all data records to be retrieved. This will become obvious if you move the scrollbar thumb to the bottom of the scrollbar alley. In a form, this scrolls the content of the list to the end of the currently fetched data records. In another application, this would scroll the content of a tabular list to the end of the list. For example, if 100 data records are to be retrieved but only 10 have been fetched so far, moving the scorllbar thumb to the bottom of the scrollbar alley would display the 10th data record, not the 100th. The scrollbar thumb will automatically move up again. Moving the scrollbar thumb down again would cause the form to fetch the next package of data records, and so on. The length of the scrollbar thumb will decrease while the number of fetched data records increases. Overview of SDM Forms SDM forms can be divided into the following main groups: ■ Organizational SDM forms These SDM forms are used for the administration and organization of data modiﬁca- tions. ■ SDM forms for data entry Figure 14 on the following page shows the interconnection between the different SDM forms.

These attributes can be used to enter query criteria if performing a query. For more information on Master Blocks, refer to the section ’Master Block’ on page 25. Further details on queries can be obtained from the section  ’Queries’ on page 6. ■ Detail Block The Detail Block provides all facilities necessary to perform the above mentioned op- erations on application data infos and application data references. FIGURE  61 Structure of the Detail Block The Detail Block shows one of three different worksheets (Application Data Info Work- sheet, Application Data Reference Worksheet, Calculation Worksheet) and a group of radio buttons for the worksheet selection. A worksheet usually contains a tabular list showing the requested data. Depending on the selected worksheet, additional form components for speciﬁc worksheet operations may appear with the tabular list. For example, if the Application Data Info Worksheet is selected, a Worksheet View Selection Pop-List appears together with the Applica- tion Data Info Tabular List. Worksheet selection group Worksheet Application Data Forms Viewing and Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos Attributes of application data infos can be viewed and modiﬁed via the Application Data Info Worksheet presented in the Detail Block of the Application Data Info Form. Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos 1. Select the Application Data Info Worksheet by clicking the radio button AD Info in the worksheet selection group. ☞ Note: After the Application Data Info Form has been selected from the SDM Menubar, the Application Data Info Worksheet is automatically presented in the Detail Block. 2. Select an application data element. Application data elements may be selected either by setting a technological address in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by entering a technological ad- dress in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode.

Fur- ther details on the Duplicate feature can be obtained from the description of the button Du- plicate on page 24. SDM Basics The Basic Structure of SDM Forms All SDM forms are composed of the same basic form components. This common standard- ized structure supports the operator in becoming familiar with the SDM forms. However, de- pending on the form’s intended purpose certain SDM forms will not need some of the com- ponents provided by the common structure and the structure of other SDM forms will slight- ly deviate from this standard. Those differences are indicated in the subsequent SDM form descriptions. The following ﬁgure 5 shows you the standardized form components using the Application Data Info Form as an example. FIGURE  5 Basic Structure of a SDM form Each SDM form is composed of the following form components: ■ SDM Menubar SDM Toolbar SDM Menubar Job Block Command Block Detail Block Message Line Master Block Status Line SDM Basics ■ SDM Toolbar ■ Job Block ■ Master Block (optional) ■ Command Block ■ Detail Block ■ Message Line ■ Status Line SDM Menubar Each SDM form provides a menu bar (the “SDM Menubar”), which is located at the top of an SDM form and runs across the entire SDM form (see ﬁgure 6 below). FIGURE  6 SDM Menubar The SDM Menubar contains the following menus: ■ File The File menu provides form-related actions. For example: Exit from form. ■ Job Use the Job menu to select organizational SDM forms dealing with job and task man- agement, such as Job Management Form, Job Log Form, Job Trace Form, Job Inter- lock Form, etc. ■ Tools Perform various SDM actions by selecting organizational SDM forms like the Model Form, Reverse Transfer Form, etc. ■ Reports Create application-speciﬁc reports by selecting the appropriate form via the Reports menu. ■ Help Get online help Information by selecting the appropriate help topic from the Help menu. The following menus can be used to access application-speciﬁc SDM forms: ■ SCADA SDM Menubar SDM Basics ■ AD ■ TCI ■ ELCOM ■ ICCP ■ NA ■ DMS ■ Graphic SDM Toolbar The SDM Toolbar is a row of buttons located beneath the SDM Menubar and provides fast access to important SDM features, e.g., creating, editing or deleting a data record, etc. (for an example of a SDM Toolbar, see ﬁgure 7 below). FIGURE  7 Example of a SDM Toolbar The standard SDM Toolbar provides seven buttons (see description below). These buttons are available in each application-speciﬁc SDM form. ☞ Note: Other buttons may be available depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation. Depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation, some of the provided buttons may be disabled. Buttons provided in the SDM Toolbar will be enabled or dis- abled dynamically. If more buttons are available than the eight buttons described below, refer to the de- scription of the concerned SDM form for more information on those buttons. The content of the SDM Toolbar in organizational SDM forms might deviate from the described SDM Toolbar conﬁguration. If so, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for more information on the speciﬁc SDM Toolbar. ■ Query If the concerned SDM form is already in Query Mode, pressing the button Query performs a query based on the entered Query Criteria. If the concerned SDM form was not in Query Mode, pressing the button Query puts the form into Query Mode. SDM Toolbar SDM Basics For more details on the Query Mode and queries, refer to the section ’Queries’ on page 6. ■ ExitQuery If the concerned SDM form is in Query Mode, pressing the button ExitQuery leaves the Query Mode without performing a query. ■ Insert Insert new (empty) data record. Pressing the button Insert creates a new data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, a new blank row is inserted into the list beneath that row where cursor is located. ☞ Note: Insert creates a new record, but does not store it. If you want to store the new data record, press the button OK or the button Apply in the Command Block of the con- cerned SDM form. For more details on the Command Block, refer to the section ’Com- mand Block’ on page 26. In case the button Insert is disabled you are currently not allowed to insert a new data record. ■ Delete Remove one or more data records from the database. Pressing the button Delete removes the currently selected data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) is removed. ☞ Note: You will not be allowed to remove a data record if there are pending data modiﬁcations on any attribute of the concerned data record. If the SDM form detects uncommitted data modiﬁcations it will request you to commit those modiﬁcations or to perform a roll- back on those modiﬁcations before you can proceed with your deletion. If the data record to be removed has associated data records in other database tables (so-called “Child Records”), those data records will also be removed. This is called ”Cascading Delete”. For example, if you remove an application data characteristic group record, this data record may have associated application data characteristic records and these may have associated characteristic segment records. If you press the button Delete to remove the application data characteristic group record all associ- ated application data characteristic records and all associated characteristic segment records will also be removed. If the data record you are about to remove has associated child records, an alert win- dow will pop up informing you that a cascading delete will be performed. At this point you can cancel the deletion or continue it by pressing the appropriate button in the alert window. ☞ Note: SDM Basics Sometimes you may encounter a long waiting time while a delete transaction is per- formed. This will especially be the case if a deletion is performed which removes a large amount of data from the database (e.g., in case of a cascading delete). Since a lot of activity takes place beneath the surface in such a case, we recommend that you break such transactions down into several smaller transactions. For example, when re- moving a large B1 block, it would be better, to delete each B2 block individually rather than to delete the entire B1 block at once. An attempt to perform a delete transaction which is too large to delete may cause an errors, especially if the system is rather busy. Deletions will automatically change the database. Once a deletion is initiated, it cannot be rolled back. To reverse the effects of a deletion, use the Cancel Task feature in the Task Log Form (see section  ’Task Log Form’ on page 60 for more details on this topic). No speciﬁc alert window will appear if a cascading delete removes child data records used in other source database tables. The inconsistency that occurs in such a case will be detected during a global validation. ■ Defaults Assign pre-deﬁned default values to the attributes of the currently selected data record. Columns of a source database table may have associated default values which are also deﬁned in the source database. If default values are available for the selected data record, the current attribute values will be replaced by the speciﬁed default values after you have pressed the button Defaults. ☞ Note: If no default values are available for the selected data record, the button Defaults will be disabled. If you intend to use default values on a data record, we recommend to use the Defaults feature before you enter any other information for this data record, since default values will overwrite all related items you have already entered for this data record. ■ Clear Remove the content of the input ﬁelds of the selected data record. If you press the button Clear, the content of all input ﬁelds of the currently selected data record will be emptied. The content of these ﬁelds will also be removed from the work space (for more information on the work space, refer tot the section ’Applying Trans- actions’ on page 17). ☞ Note: Unlike Delete (see description on page 22), pressing the button Clear will not remove the concerned data record from the database. SDM Basics If you did not apply your data modiﬁcations on the currently selected data record yet, and you have pressed the button Clear, the entire data record will be removed. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be removed. ■ Duplicate Duplicate the preceding data record and insert this copy as a new data record. If you press the button Duplicate, a copy of the preceding data record will be inserted as a new data record. ☞ Note: Attributes that require unique information will not be copied and the concerned input ﬁelds in the new data record will be left blank. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be copied and in- serted as a new row below the selected row. ■ MSG Open the Error Message Form. Pressing the button MSG opens the Error Message Form that shows the error messag- es of the job you are currently connected to. For a detailed description of the informa- tion displayed in the Error Message Form, refer to the section ’Error Message Form’ on page 72. ■ Longhint Display a long hint text. Move the cursor to the input ﬁeld of an attribute and press the button Longhint. Then, the long hint associated with the respective attribute will be displayed in the Message Line of the respective SDM form. ☞ Note: Just like “short” hints (see section ’Hints’ on page 6 for details), long hints must be de- ﬁned in the source database table where the concerned attribute is deﬁned. If no long hint is available for the respective attribute, the button Longhint will be dis- abled. The accessibility of the button Longhint may change every time you move the cursor to another input ﬁeld depending on the availability of a long hint in the con- cerned source database table. Job Block The Job Block is located in the upper left corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains display ﬁelds showing job information and job interlock information. SDM Basics FIGURE  8 Example of a Job Block ■ Job Shows the name of the job accessing the respective SDM form. ■ Job Interlock If a job interlock for the entire SDM form exists, the display ﬁeld of the attribute Job Interlock shows the name of the locking job. ☞ Note: Depending on the hierarchical level of the data presented by the form, this attribute might not appear. For more details on job interlocks, refer to the section ’Job Inter- locks’ on page 4. Master Block The Master Block is an optional form component. Its availability in a SDM form depends on the form’s intended purpose and the hierarchical level of the data presented by the respec- tive SDM form. The Master Block provides attributes representing the primary database keys of the con- cerned data object. The input ﬁelds of the provided attributes are used to enter query crite- ria when performing a query. ☞ Note: Before you can use the Master Block, you must switch to Query Mode. For more de- tails on the Query Mode, refer to the section  ’Query Mode’ on page 7. For detailed information on the availability of a master block in a speciﬁc SDM form and its content, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form. Job SDM Basics FIGURE  9 Example of a Master Block Command Block The command block is located in the upper right corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains the following buttons to apply and discard data modiﬁcations per- formed in the SDM form: ■ OK Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database and exits the concerned SDM form. ■ Apply Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database. The concerned SDM form remains and further data modiﬁcations can be performed. ■ Cancel Dismisses the performed data modiﬁcations. The data modiﬁcations will not be ap- plied to the database.",

When actual network states are logically con- nected, then (depending on the special rule which is fulﬁlled in this case and the respective alternatives) certain ﬁgures and/or attributes are selected from the alternative groups of ﬁg- ures and attributes, to display this network state. The following forms are provided for com- bination decision tables: ■ Circuit Speciﬁc Combinations Form ■ Element Speciﬁc Combinations Form ■ Individual (1:1) Combinations Form Furthermore the following forms for deﬁning interlocking decision tables are provided: ■ Superior Interlocking Conditions Form ■ Global Area Interlocking Conditions Form ■ Local Area Interlocking Conditions Form ■ Function Speciﬁc Interlocking Conditions Form Before deﬁning conditions for a decision table, the decision table ﬁrst has to be deﬁned with its general attributes in the Decision Table Deﬁnition Form. Decision Table Forms Decision Table Deﬁnition Form When creating a new decision table, at ﬁrst its general attributes have to be deﬁned in the Decision Table Deﬁnition Form. Only after creating the decision table in this form, the re- spective decision table type-speciﬁc form can be used for deﬁning conditions.

For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding sections in chapter ’SDM Basics’ on page 3 in this document. ■ Detail Block Detail Block of the Decision Table Deﬁnition Form The Detail Block of the Decision Table Deﬁnition Form contains a tabular list for deﬁning general attributes of a decision table. This tabular list consists of the following columns: ■ DT-Nr Number of the decision table, which must be unique for all decision table types. ■ DT-Name This column indicates the name of the decision table. ■ DT-Group In this column the group the decision table belongs to can be deﬁned. Possible input is either “interlocking” or “combinations”. ■ DT-Type This column deﬁnes the type of the decision table. Depending on the decision table group the following input is possible: – for group “interlocking”: - funcspec-interl. - superior-interl.",

It contains the following button: ■ Cancel Exits the Job Interlock Form. If you press this button, the Job Interlock Form will be closed and the Job Management Form will appear. Organizational SDM Forms Job Interlock List The Job Interlock List is a tabular list that shows job interlock information. Each line of the tabular list represents a single job interlock. The columns of the list contain the attributes of the respective job interlock. A scrollbar is attached to the tabular list which can be used to quickly navigate through the list. Changes in the list are updated automatically. ■ Job Name The name (up to eight characters) identiﬁes a job in the system. ■ Task Name Shows the name of the concerned task that has been performed. ■ Task ID Shows the number (task ID) of the concerned task that has been performed. ■ Lock Type Shows the type of data that is locked, e.g., reference or block data, etc. . ■ Lock Level Shows the hierarchical level of the locked data object, e.g., B1, B2, B3, Element, Info, etc. . ■ Key 1 ■ Key 2 ■ Key 3 ■ Key 4 ■ Key 5 These 5 columns show the concerned database keys of the locked data object. For example: in case of a locked info, these attributes will show the B1-name, the B2-name, the B3-name, the Element name and the Info name of the locked info. In case of a locked application data characteristic group, the attribute Key 1 will show the name of the locked application data characteristic group, etc. Organizational SDM Forms Task Log Form The Task Log Form allows you to view the chronology of the tasks for a particular job. It also allows you to cancel the last one of these tasks. It can be selected under the menu Job in the SDM Menubar. Each task and its identifying parameters are shown in one line of the Task Information Block. There is a scrollbar at the right side of the list to scroll the list, as there can be more tasks deﬁned than one page can show.

      "Application Data Forms SDM provides a variety of forms and features for the conﬁguration of application data. These facilities deal with application data infos, application data references, application data characteristic groups, application data characteristics and schedules. Separate forms are provided for each of the application data classes mentioned above to maintain their individual attributes and characteristics. The available forms are listed below: ■ Application Data Info Form The Application Data Info Form deals with attributes of application data infos, associ- ated additional information and application data references (refer to the description in section  ’Application Data Info Form’ on page 155 for further details). ■ Application Data Characteristic Groups Form The Application Data Characteristic Groups Form provides facilities for the handling of application data characteristic groups (refer to the description in section ’Application Data Characteristic Groups Form’ on page 180 for further details). ■ Application Data Characteristics Form The Application Data Characteristics Form provides facilities for the handling of at- tributes of application data characteristics and application data characteristic seg- ments (refer to the description in section ’Application Data Characteristics Form’ on page 187 for further details). ■ Schedule Form The Schedule Form provides facilities for the conﬁguration of schedules (refer to the description in section  ’Schedule Form’ on page 207 for further details). Application Data Forms Application Data Info Form The Application Data Info Form deals with application data infos and application data refer- ences. The facilities provided by the Application Data Info Form can be used to perform the following operations on these application data classes: ■ View or modify attributes of application data infos ■ Enter or modify additional information associated with application data infos ■ View, enter or modify calculation attributes of calculated application data infos ■ View, enter or modify application data references. Structure of the Application Data Info Form The Application Data Info Form supports the above described features by a hierarchically structured Detail Block using worksheets and other graphical form components grouped in a feature-oriented way. The basic structure of the Application Data Info Form is shown in ﬁgure 59: FIGURE  59 Basic Structure of the Application Data Info Form SDM Toolbar SDM Menubar Job Block Command Block Detail Block Message Line Master Block Status Line Application Data Forms The Application Data Info Form is composed of the following components: ■ SDM Menubar ■ Message Line ■ Job Block ■ Command Block These form components are common in all SDM forms. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding sections in chapter 3, section ’SDM Basics’ on page 3 in this document. ■ SDM Toolbar Besides the seven standard toolbar buttons (see section ’SDM Toolbar’ on page 21 for more details), the SDM Toolbar of the Application Data Info Form provides the fol- lowing additional buttons: – Query TAs Opens the Query Window. – Paste Inserts technological addresses from the internal clipboard.",
      "The concerned SDM form will be exited. FIGURE  10 Command Block Master Block Command Block SDM Basics Detail Block The detail block of a SDM form contains all form components that are provided to perform the form’s intended purpose. The actual content of the detail block varies from SDM form to SDM form and may change dynamically depending on the operator’s interaction with SDM. For more details on the form components actually provided by the detail block, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form. Message Line Each SDM form contains a message line that is used to display hint texts (for more details, refer to the section ’Hints’ on page 6) and system messages. It is located at the bottom of the SDM form and reaches across the entire form. FIGURE  11 Message line Message Line SDM Basics Status Line Each SDM form contains a status line that is used to indicate modes and other status infor- mation. For example: the status line indicates form modes, such as Query Mode (see section ’Query Mode’ on page 7), character modes, e.g., insert characters or replace char- acters, the number of records retrieved by a query, etc. . FIGURE  12 Status line Scrollbars Scrollbars allow you to quickly navigate through a set of data records, e.g., in a tabular list. Scrollbars can be attached either horizontally or vertically. FIGURE  13 Example of a vertical scrollbar ☞ Note: The behavior of scrollbars in forms slightly deviates from the behavior of scrollbars you might be familiar with from other applications. The differences are described below. Status Line Number of records retrieved by a query Form mode Character mode Vertical scrollbar Scrollbar thumb Scrollbar alley SDM Basics As usual, the position of the scrollbar thumb in the scrollbar alley gives you a feedback of the relative position of the current data record within the respective set of data records (e.g., within a tabular list). The length of the scrollbar thumb will give you information on the num- ber of retrieved data records. However, since forms retrieve data records on a package basis, “set of data records” does not necessarily mean “all available data records”, but the set of data records that have been fetched so far. This may or may not include all data records to be retrieved. This will become obvious if you move the scrollbar thumb to the bottom of the scrollbar alley. In a form, this scrolls the content of the list to the end of the currently fetched data records. In another application, this would scroll the content of a tabular list to the end of the list. For example, if 100 data records are to be retrieved but only 10 have been fetched so far, moving the scorllbar thumb to the bottom of the scrollbar alley would display the 10th data record, not the 100th. The scrollbar thumb will automatically move up again. Moving the scrollbar thumb down again would cause the form to fetch the next package of data records, and so on. The length of the scrollbar thumb will decrease while the number of fetched data records increases. Overview of SDM Forms SDM forms can be divided into the following main groups: ■ Organizational SDM forms These SDM forms are used for the administration and organization of data modiﬁca- tions. ■ SDM forms for data entry Figure 14 on the following page shows the interconnection between the different SDM forms.

Fur- ther details on the Duplicate feature can be obtained from the description of the button Du- plicate on page 24. SDM Basics The Basic Structure of SDM Forms All SDM forms are composed of the same basic form components. This common standard- ized structure supports the operator in becoming familiar with the SDM forms. However, de- pending on the form’s intended purpose certain SDM forms will not need some of the com- ponents provided by the common structure and the structure of other SDM forms will slight- ly deviate from this standard. Those differences are indicated in the subsequent SDM form descriptions. The following ﬁgure 5 shows you the standardized form components using the Application Data Info Form as an example. FIGURE  5 Basic Structure of a SDM form Each SDM form is composed of the following form components: ■ SDM Menubar SDM Toolbar SDM Menubar Job Block Command Block Detail Block Message Line Master Block Status Line SDM Basics ■ SDM Toolbar ■ Job Block ■ Master Block (optional) ■ Command Block ■ Detail Block ■ Message Line ■ Status Line SDM Menubar Each SDM form provides a menu bar (the “SDM Menubar”), which is located at the top of an SDM form and runs across the entire SDM form (see ﬁgure 6 below). FIGURE  6 SDM Menubar The SDM Menubar contains the following menus: ■ File The File menu provides form-related actions. For example: Exit from form. ■ Job Use the Job menu to select organizational SDM forms dealing with job and task man- agement, such as Job Management Form, Job Log Form, Job Trace Form, Job Inter- lock Form, etc. ■ Tools Perform various SDM actions by selecting organizational SDM forms like the Model Form, Reverse Transfer Form, etc. ■ Reports Create application-speciﬁc reports by selecting the appropriate form via the Reports menu. ■ Help Get online help Information by selecting the appropriate help topic from the Help menu. The following menus can be used to access application-speciﬁc SDM forms: ■ SCADA SDM Menubar SDM Basics ■ AD ■ TCI ■ ELCOM ■ ICCP ■ NA ■ DMS ■ Graphic SDM Toolbar The SDM Toolbar is a row of buttons located beneath the SDM Menubar and provides fast access to important SDM features, e.g., creating, editing or deleting a data record, etc. (for an example of a SDM Toolbar, see ﬁgure 7 below). FIGURE  7 Example of a SDM Toolbar The standard SDM Toolbar provides seven buttons (see description below). These buttons are available in each application-speciﬁc SDM form. ☞ Note: Other buttons may be available depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation. Depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation, some of the provided buttons may be disabled. Buttons provided in the SDM Toolbar will be enabled or dis- abled dynamically. If more buttons are available than the eight buttons described below, refer to the de- scription of the concerned SDM form for more information on those buttons. The content of the SDM Toolbar in organizational SDM forms might deviate from the described SDM Toolbar conﬁguration. If so, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for more information on the speciﬁc SDM Toolbar. ■ Query If the concerned SDM form is already in Query Mode, pressing the button Query performs a query based on the entered Query Criteria. If the concerned SDM form was not in Query Mode, pressing the button Query puts the form into Query Mode. SDM Toolbar SDM Basics For more details on the Query Mode and queries, refer to the section ’Queries’ on page 6. ■ ExitQuery If the concerned SDM form is in Query Mode, pressing the button ExitQuery leaves the Query Mode without performing a query. ■ Insert Insert new (empty) data record. Pressing the button Insert creates a new data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, a new blank row is inserted into the list beneath that row where cursor is located. ☞ Note: Insert creates a new record, but does not store it. If you want to store the new data record, press the button OK or the button Apply in the Command Block of the con- cerned SDM form. For more details on the Command Block, refer to the section ’Com- mand Block’ on page 26. In case the button Insert is disabled you are currently not allowed to insert a new data record. ■ Delete Remove one or more data records from the database. Pressing the button Delete removes the currently selected data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) is removed. ☞ Note: You will not be allowed to remove a data record if there are pending data modiﬁcations on any attribute of the concerned data record. If the SDM form detects uncommitted data modiﬁcations it will request you to commit those modiﬁcations or to perform a roll- back on those modiﬁcations before you can proceed with your deletion. If the data record to be removed has associated data records in other database tables (so-called “Child Records”), those data records will also be removed. This is called ”Cascading Delete”. For example, if you remove an application data characteristic group record, this data record may have associated application data characteristic records and these may have associated characteristic segment records. If you press the button Delete to remove the application data characteristic group record all associ- ated application data characteristic records and all associated characteristic segment records will also be removed. If the data record you are about to remove has associated child records, an alert win- dow will pop up informing you that a cascading delete will be performed. At this point you can cancel the deletion or continue it by pressing the appropriate button in the alert window. ☞ Note: SDM Basics Sometimes you may encounter a long waiting time while a delete transaction is per- formed. This will especially be the case if a deletion is performed which removes a large amount of data from the database (e.g., in case of a cascading delete). Since a lot of activity takes place beneath the surface in such a case, we recommend that you break such transactions down into several smaller transactions. For example, when re- moving a large B1 block, it would be better, to delete each B2 block individually rather than to delete the entire B1 block at once. An attempt to perform a delete transaction which is too large to delete may cause an errors, especially if the system is rather busy. Deletions will automatically change the database. Once a deletion is initiated, it cannot be rolled back. To reverse the effects of a deletion, use the Cancel Task feature in the Task Log Form (see section  ’Task Log Form’ on page 60 for more details on this topic). No speciﬁc alert window will appear if a cascading delete removes child data records used in other source database tables. The inconsistency that occurs in such a case will be detected during a global validation. ■ Defaults Assign pre-deﬁned default values to the attributes of the currently selected data record. Columns of a source database table may have associated default values which are also deﬁned in the source database. If default values are available for the selected data record, the current attribute values will be replaced by the speciﬁed default values after you have pressed the button Defaults. ☞ Note: If no default values are available for the selected data record, the button Defaults will be disabled. If you intend to use default values on a data record, we recommend to use the Defaults feature before you enter any other information for this data record, since default values will overwrite all related items you have already entered for this data record. ■ Clear Remove the content of the input ﬁelds of the selected data record. If you press the button Clear, the content of all input ﬁelds of the currently selected data record will be emptied. The content of these ﬁelds will also be removed from the work space (for more information on the work space, refer tot the section ’Applying Trans- actions’ on page 17). ☞ Note: Unlike Delete (see description on page 22), pressing the button Clear will not remove the concerned data record from the database. SDM Basics If you did not apply your data modiﬁcations on the currently selected data record yet, and you have pressed the button Clear, the entire data record will be removed. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be removed. ■ Duplicate Duplicate the preceding data record and insert this copy as a new data record. If you press the button Duplicate, a copy of the preceding data record will be inserted as a new data record. ☞ Note: Attributes that require unique information will not be copied and the concerned input ﬁelds in the new data record will be left blank. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be copied and in- serted as a new row below the selected row. ■ MSG Open the Error Message Form. Pressing the button MSG opens the Error Message Form that shows the error messag- es of the job you are currently connected to. For a detailed description of the informa- tion displayed in the Error Message Form, refer to the section ’Error Message Form’ on page 72. ■ Longhint Display a long hint text. Move the cursor to the input ﬁeld of an attribute and press the button Longhint. Then, the long hint associated with the respective attribute will be displayed in the Message Line of the respective SDM form. ☞ Note: Just like “short” hints (see section ’Hints’ on page 6 for details), long hints must be de- ﬁned in the source database table where the concerned attribute is deﬁned. If no long hint is available for the respective attribute, the button Longhint will be dis- abled. The accessibility of the button Longhint may change every time you move the cursor to another input ﬁeld depending on the availability of a long hint in the con- cerned source database table. Job Block The Job Block is located in the upper left corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains display ﬁelds showing job information and job interlock information. SDM Basics FIGURE  8 Example of a Job Block ■ Job Shows the name of the job accessing the respective SDM form. ■ Job Interlock If a job interlock for the entire SDM form exists, the display ﬁeld of the attribute Job Interlock shows the name of the locking job. ☞ Note: Depending on the hierarchical level of the data presented by the form, this attribute might not appear. For more details on job interlocks, refer to the section ’Job Inter- locks’ on page 4. Master Block The Master Block is an optional form component. Its availability in a SDM form depends on the form’s intended purpose and the hierarchical level of the data presented by the respec- tive SDM form. The Master Block provides attributes representing the primary database keys of the con- cerned data object. The input ﬁelds of the provided attributes are used to enter query crite- ria when performing a query. ☞ Note: Before you can use the Master Block, you must switch to Query Mode. For more de- tails on the Query Mode, refer to the section  ’Query Mode’ on page 7. For detailed information on the availability of a master block in a speciﬁc SDM form and its content, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form. Job SDM Basics FIGURE  9 Example of a Master Block Command Block The command block is located in the upper right corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains the following buttons to apply and discard data modiﬁcations per- formed in the SDM form: ■ OK Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database and exits the concerned SDM form. ■ Apply Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database. The concerned SDM form remains and further data modiﬁcations can be performed. ■ Cancel Dismisses the performed data modiﬁcations. The data modiﬁcations will not be ap- plied to the database.",
      "SDM Basics This chapter deals with basic SDM principles. It describes the following major aspects of SDM: ■ Basic concepts and operation procedures that apply to all SDM forms ■ The basic structure of the SDM forms SDM Basics Before you can go into the details of speciﬁc SDM forms, it is necessary to know the basic principles, features and operation procedures that are common to all SDM forms. The knowledge of these basics will help you to improve your understanding of the following chapters dealing with details of speciﬁc SDM forms. ☞ Note: The following detailed SDM form descriptions will presuppose knowledge of the basic SDM principles, features and operation procedures. Job Management The method by which database changes are grouped and controlled is called Job Manage- ment. It applies to SDM forms just as it would to any other data changing process. In order to modify data, you must be connected to a legitimate job that is in status Ready. To connect to a job, i.e., to resume an existing job or to create a new job, enter the job name into the text ﬁeld of the attribute Job Name in the Job Management Form. Other actions related with job management are performed via the Job Log Form. For further details on SDM Basics these forms, refer to the sections ’Job Management Form’ on page 34 and ’Job Log Form’ on page 50. You will not be able to insert, update and delete data via a SDM form, if you are not con- nected to a job or if you are connected to an unavailable job. In this case, the rights to insert, update and delete data will be disabled for the respective SDM form. In other words, you will solely have a read-only access to the concerned data. Job Interlocks Job interlocks prevent different jobs from modifying the same data by locking the data the jobs uses. This means that you cannot modify data which are locked by another job and other jobs cannot modify data your job has locked. Job interlocks are enforced in two ways depending on the hierarchical level of the data to be modiﬁed: ■ For entire forms This type of job interlock is enforced for data entities on a lower hierarchical level of a data hierarchy (for example: Elem is the 4th hierarchical level of the SCADA data hier- archy B1/B2/B3/Elem/Info, etc.). A job interlock may exist for all attributes of all data records shown in the respective form. The job interlock information is shown in the dis- play ﬁeld of the attribute Job Interlock in the Job Block of the respective form. For example: if you intend to modify an element record (identiﬁed by a particular tech- nological identiﬁer composed of B1, B2, B3 and Element Names) and another opera- tor already modiﬁes a B1, B2 or B3 data record involved in the technological identiﬁer of your element record, a job interlock on your Element Form will exist. You will not be able to apply modiﬁcations on any attribute of your element record as long as the job interlock exists. ■ For individual data records shown in a form This type of job interlock is enforced for top-level data entities (for example: B1 is the top-level data entity of the SCADA data hierarchy B1/B2/B3/Elem/Info, etc.). Different job interlocks may exist for different data records shown in the respective form. The job interlock information is associated with the concerned data record. Usually, the re- spective form contains a tabular list that shows the available data records. In this case, the job interlock information is shown in a separate column of this list. For example: if you intend to modify B1 blocks via the B1 Form, you might notice, that the tabular list contains a column Job Interlock that shows the job interlocks for the available B1 records. In either case, the following rule applies: If the value in the job interlock ﬁeld is zero (blank), you can perform your data modiﬁcation. If the concerned data are locked by another job, the name of the job that “holds” the inter- lock will appear in the job interlock ﬁeld. SDM Basics To view a job’s interlock history and other pertinent job interlock information, use the Job Interlock Form. For more details on this form, refer to the section ’Job Interlock Form’ on page 57. Validation Every attempt is made to validate data at the earliest possible moment. If a data entity can be veriﬁed at the item level, it is automatically veriﬁed. If data can only be veriﬁed within the context of an entire record, the validation will occur at the record level. If veriﬁcation of data requires that a number of records be completed or that an entire set of data be in place, validation will occur during Global Validation. Item Level Validation Simple data checks of single attributes will occur at the item level. If you modify an attribute so that its new value exceeds the attribute’s value range or if you enter a value that is not in the attribute’s list of valid values, SDM will notify you that the attribute value is not valid. If validation fails, the cursor is moved back into the input ﬁeld of the invalid attribute and an error message will appear in the window message line of the respective SDM form. It is rec- ommended that you correct the error before you continue. However, if this is one of those cases where the entered value shall violate the validation rule, you may ignore the error message and continue. The error will not be indicated a second time. Although SDM will not bother you with error messages beyond the ﬁrst message, an error message for each uncorrected attribute will be stored in the error message table when you ﬁnally commit your changes (for further information on this topic, refer to the section ’Error Messages’ on page 6 in this chapter). Record Level Validation Data checks that require the comparison of two or more attributes within a data record will be performed at the record level. Errors will be indicated if you move the cursor out of the modiﬁed data record. If validation fails, an alert window will appear. This alert window offers you the following op- tions: “Fix Data Errors” or “Skip Validation”. It is recommended that you correct the error be- fore you continue. However, if this is one of those cases where the entered value shall vio- late the validation rule, you may ignore the error message and continue. The error will not be indicated a second time. Although SDM will not bother you with error messages beyond the ﬁrst message, an error message for each uncorrected attribute will be stored in the error message table when you ﬁnally commit your changes (for further information on this topic, refer to the section ’Error Messages’ on page 6 in this chapter). SDM Basics Global Validation Global Validation compares data between similar data records, between different types of data records, and between data records of various data hierarchies. By its nature, Global Validation requires that you have the data in a stable state before you perform it. Global Val- idation can be performed whenever you complete a data editing session and is enforced before you attempt to perform a job transfer. Hints Hints are short messages describing data attributes. They will appear in the window mes- sage line of an SDM form after a mouseclick on the input ﬁeld of an attribute shown in the respective form. Hints are generated from the domain information deﬁned for the respective column in the concerned source database table. A hint will be displayed only if the message that was previously shown in the window mes- sage line was blank or another hint. If the previous message was an error message, the hint will not be displayed. Sometimes, when you move the cursor to the input ﬁeld of another attribute after an error message has been displayed, the hint related with the currently se- lected attribute will not be displayed. If you want the hint to be displayed, click on the input ﬁeld of a another attribute and then click on the input ﬁeld of the desired attribute again. Error Messages Ignoring error messages if they initially appear will not cause a loss of data. All error mes- sages are written into the corresponding source database message table when the data modiﬁcations are applied to the database. Depending on the current situation, error mes- sages will be displayed in the window message line of the respective SDM form or in a sep- arately opened alert window. If errors occur during the apply transaction of data modiﬁcations, an alert window will be displayed indicating the number of error messages that have been stored in the correspond- ing source database message table. If you press the button MSG in the SDM Toolbar imme- diately after you have acknowledged this message, the Error Message Form will appear and will show the ﬁrst error of those error messages. Queries If you select an SDM form, it will automatically come up with a full set of data if valid preset values have been provided in the Job Management Form. In this case, the logic behind the form is able to perform an automatic query on the requested data based on the provided preset values. However, if no preset values have been speciﬁed in the Job Management Form or if the speciﬁed preset values are invalid, the form comes up empty and will auto- matically switch to Query Mode. This means, the ﬁrst action you must perform before you can work with the respective SDM form must be a query to retrieve data to work with. SDM Basics Even if your preset values are correct and the SDM form has come up with a full set of data, you may perform a new query to retrieve another set of data to work with. Query Mode If no preset values have been speciﬁed in the Job Management Form or if the speciﬁed pre- set values are invalid, a selected SDM form comes up empty and switches automatically to Query Mode. Query Mode can be recognized by an appropriate system message that appears in the win- dow status line of the respective SDM form (see ﬁgure 1 below), by the status of the SDM Toolbar (all buttons of the SDM Toolbar, except the button Query, are disabled) and the con- tent of the input ﬁelds of the concerned SDM form (when entering Query Mode, the input ﬁelds are emptied). FIGURE  1 Indication of Query Mode in the Status Line of the respective SDM form If the SDM form you have selected comes up in Query Mode, you must perform a query before you can perform your intended data modiﬁcations. Detailed information on how to perform a query can be obtained from the section ’Performing a Query’ on page 11 in this chapter. ☞ Note: If the selected SDM form is in Query Mode and a query has not been performed, any operation that is not involved in performing a query will be rejected and an appropriate system message will appear in the window message line of the respective SDM form. Even if you can obviously enter data into the text ﬁelds of the respective SDM form, you will not be able to store these entries in the database since the buttons of the Com- mand Block are disabled. After you have performed a query, Query Mode is terminated automatically. If your SDM form is currently not in Query Mode and you want to perform a query, you must invoke Query Mode and then you can enter the Query Criteria and perform your query. For more details on how to perform a query, refer to the section ’Performing a Query’ below. Query Mode can be cancelled (even without performing a query) by selecting Exit from the File menu in the SDM Menubar. After the Query Mode has been cancelled, the buttons of the SDM Toolbar and the buttons of the Command Block in your SDM form might be en- abled, if appropriate. Then, you can select another SDM form from menus of the SDM Menubar or you can enter new data into the empty form. ☞ Note: This system message indicates Query Mode SDM Basics If you enter new data into your empty form and you apply those data modiﬁcations by pressing the button Apply in the Command Block of your form, your data modiﬁcations will be applied to the source database and a query on all available data records of the respective data entity will be performed. Query Criteria Using the query feature, all available data records of a speciﬁc data entity or a subset of the available data records matching certain query criteria can be retrieved. The number of retrieved data records will be displayed in the Status Line of the respective SDM form. FIGURE  2 Number of retrieved data records indicated in the Status Line of the SDM form For the retrieval of a subset of the available data records that match certain criteria, the SDM forms provide the following possibilities to specify query criteria: ■ Retrieval of data records matching exact values You can retrieve speciﬁc data records by entering exact values for the query criteria. For example, if you enter Vienna into the text ﬁeld of the attribute B1-Name in the Master Block of the B3 Form and 220 into the text ﬁeld of the attribute B1-Name in the Master Block of the B3 Form, the query will select all records in which the B1-block name is Vienna and the B2-block name is 220. ■ Retrieval of data records matching a search patterns You can also retrieve data records that match a particular search pattern composed of a value (e.g., a character string) and the wildcard characters underscore (“_”) or per- centage (“%”) or a combination of both. The wildcard character “_” represents any single character. The wildcard character “%” represents any combination of characters (including no character). For example, the B1-block name Vienna would match both the search pattern Vienn_ and the search pattern Vie%. Query Window Besides Query Mode and the query facilities in the Master Block, SDM provides a particular window for the retrieval of technological addresses. This window is called “Query Window”.

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be conﬁgured as “calculated application data infos”, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section ’Calculation Worksheet’ on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. ☞ Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section ’Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos’ on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see ﬁgure 61 on page 157). 2.

Assign a calculation formula to the selected application data by entering the name of the desired formula into the text ﬁeld of the attribute Formula or double-click on the Application Data Forms text ﬁeld of the attribute Formula to open a list of values and choose the desired name from the list of values. ☞ Note: The desired formula must have been deﬁned via SDM before the name of the con- cerned formula can be assigned. The data type of the result of the chosen formula must match the application data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the application data type of the selected application data info speciﬁes the application data info to be a binary value, the result of the chosen formula must also be a binary value, etc. . An attempt to assign a formula whose result data type does not match with the data type of the selected application data info will be rejected. Modifying a formula assignment 1. Select the desired application data info.",
      "Opens the ﬁgure group/text group window. ☞ Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is conﬁgured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section ’Additional Information Windows’ on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  ’Handling of Additional Information’ on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. ■ AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ■ Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ■ Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the conﬁgured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system conﬁguration phase and cannot be modiﬁed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- ﬁgured: – SDM Info value can be entered or modiﬁed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. – UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modiﬁed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modiﬁcations become effective immediately. – IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  ’Additional Information Window Button’ on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is conﬁgured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speciﬁed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modiﬁed via SDM. ☞ Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modiﬁed via SDM at any time only, if – input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modiﬁed via SDM, if – input mode is SDM and application data type speciﬁes a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms – input mode is UI and a value has been entered already – input mode is IO ■ Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info.

A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text ﬁeld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text ﬁeld in the column Schedule. ☞ Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. ■ Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references deﬁne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference “terminals” that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference “terminal” of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  ’Application Data Reference Worksheet’ on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section ’List Available Application Data References’ above. 2. Create a reference between a reference “terminal” of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference “terminal” in the column Ref- erence. 3.",

This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference “terminal” of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  ’Application Data Reference Worksheet’ on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section ’List Available Application Data References’ above. 2. Create a reference between a reference “terminal” of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference “terminal” in the column Ref- erence. 3."

Application Data Forms Handling Attributes of Calculated Application Data Infos Some application data infos may be conﬁgured as “calculated application data infos”, i.e., they are results of a formula calculation. The Application Data Info Form supports this fea- ture by providing a separate Calculation Worksheet that can be used to assign a formula to an application data info or to enter or to modify the attributes of the calculation operands of the assigned formula. For further details on the Calculation Worksheet, refer to the section ’Calculation Worksheet’ on page 167). Assigning a formula to an application data info 1. Select the desired application data info. ☞ Note: The selected application data info must be a calculated application data info, i.e., the input mode of the selected application data info must have been set to IO. The application data info can be selected from the Application Data Info Tabular List of the Application Data Info Worksheet or from the pop-list Info Name in the Result Block of the Calculation Worksheet. In both cases, the desired worksheet and an ap- plication data element must be selected before the application data info can be cho- sen. For details on how to select the Application Data Info Worksheet and an application data element, refer to the section ’Modifying Attributes of Application Data Infos’ on page 158. The Calculation Worksheet can be selected by clicking the radio button Calculation in the worksheet selection group of the Detail Block (see ﬁgure 61 on page 157). 2.

A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section ’Additional Information Windows’ on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  ’Handling of Additional Information’ on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. ■ AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ■ Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ■ Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the conﬁgured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system conﬁguration phase and cannot be modiﬁed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- ﬁgured: – SDM Info value can be entered or modiﬁed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. – UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modiﬁed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modiﬁcations become effective immediately. – IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  ’Additional Information Window Button’ on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is conﬁgured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speciﬁed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modiﬁed via SDM. ☞ Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modiﬁed via SDM at any time only, if – input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modiﬁed via SDM, if – input mode is SDM and application data type speciﬁes a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms – input mode is UI and a value has been entered already – input mode is IO ■ Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ☞ Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system’s conﬁguration phase and cannot be modiﬁed via SDM at a later time. ■ Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text ﬁeld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text ﬁeld in the column Schedule. ☞ Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. ■ Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references deﬁne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference “terminals” that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference “terminal” of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  ’Application Data Reference Worksheet’ on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section ’List Available Application Data References’ above. 2.

After a calculation formula has been selected and at least one calculation operand has been speciﬁed, the text ﬁeld of the attribute For- mula will be protected and the assigned formula cannot be modiﬁed. A calculation formula can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available calculation formula into the text ﬁeld of the attribute Formula or by selecting a formula name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text ﬁeld of the attribute Formu- la. ☞ Note: The list of values shows only those formulae whose result data type corresponds to the data type of the selected application data info. For example, if the main info value of the selected application data info is a boolean value, the list of values shows only those formulae whose result is a boolean. Operands Tabular List ■ Operand Contains the name of the respective calculation operand. A calculation operand can be speciﬁed by entering the operand’s name into the re- spective text ﬁeld in the column Operand or by selecting an operand name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text ﬁeld in the column Operand. ☞ Note: The number of calculation operands is pre-deﬁned and may vary depending on the se- lected formula. The list of values shows only those calculation operands that are re- quired for the calculation of the selected formula. If all required calculation operands have been speciﬁed, the deﬁnition of further calcu- lation operands will be rejected. An appropriate system message will appear. ■ Type Contains the operand type. The operand type speciﬁes whether the value of the oper- and is a constant or is taken from a separate info speciﬁed by a technological address. In the latter case, the attribute setting also speciﬁes whether the value must negated or not. The operand type can be speciﬁed by entering the name of the operand type into the respective text ﬁeld in the column Type or by selecting an operand type name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values window pops up after a double-click in the respective text ﬁeld in the column Type. ☞ Note: Application Data Forms The possibility to use a certain operand type for the respective operand depends on the deﬁnition of the selected formula.",
      "Opens the ﬁgure group/text group window. ☞ Note: If no button appears after the selection of an application data info, the selected appli- cation data info is conﬁgured to have no associated additional information. A description of the available additional information windows can be obtained from section ’Additional Information Windows’ on page 172. For more information on the handling of addition information associated with application data infos, refer to the section  ’Handling of Additional Information’ on page 171 Application Data Info Tabular List The Application Data Info Worksheet contains a tabular list that shows the attributes of the application data infos of the selected application data element. Each line of the tabular list represents a single application data info record. The columns AD Info, Info Text, Value, Unit, Schedule and Characteristic group contain the associated attribute values of the respective application data info. ■ AD Info Application Data Forms Name of the respective application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ■ Info Text Info text of the selected application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ■ Value The main value of the respective application data info. The possibility to enter a value for an application data info depends on the conﬁgured input mode and the application data type of the respective application data info. The input mode of an application data info is set during the system conﬁguration phase and cannot be modiﬁed via SDM at a later time. One of three input modes can be con- ﬁgured: – SDM Info value can be entered or modiﬁed via SDM at any time. The entered value will replace the current info value immediately after the job has been executed. – UI A value can be entered via SDM at any time. The entered value is a preset value that replaces the current info value only after a system run-up. While the system is up in online realtime mode, the info value can be modiﬁed via substation dis- plays or tabular displays using the Value Selection and Value Operations feature of the UI. Those value modiﬁcations become effective immediately. – IO Info value is the result of a calculation or is set by an application and cannot be entered via SDM. An info value can be entered only for those application data infos whose application data type does not specify an associated technological address as an additional infor- mation (button TA ... must not appear after an application data info has been selected - see section  ’Additional Information Window Button’ on page 160, too). In the other case (application data info is conﬁgured to have an associated technolog- ical address as an additional information, i.e., button TA ... appears after the applica- tion data info has been selected), the database record number of the info speciﬁed by the associated technological address is automatically taken as the main application data info value. Those application data info values cannot be modiﬁed via SDM. ☞ Note: The main info value of an application data info can be entered/modiﬁed via SDM at any time only, if – input mode is SDM and application data type does not specify a technological ad- dress as an additional information. The main info value of an application data info cannot be entered/modiﬁed via SDM, if – input mode is SDM and application data type speciﬁes a technological address as an additional information Application Data Forms – input mode is UI and a value has been entered already – input mode is IO ■ Unit The engineering unit of the respective application data info. Read-only display ﬁeld. ☞ Note: The engineering unit has been assigned to an application data info during the system’s conﬁguration phase and cannot be modiﬁed via SDM at a later time. ■ Schedule Shows the name of the assigned schedule. A schedule can be assigned to the selected application data info by entering the name of an available schedule into the respective text ﬁeld in the column Schedule or by se- lecting a schedule name from the corresponding list of values. The list of values win- dow pops up after a double-click in the respective text ﬁeld in the column Schedule. ☞ Note: The list of values shows only those schedules that have been assigned for the select- ed combination of application data element and application data info. If the operator attempts to enter the name of a schedule that has not been assigned to the selected combination of application data element and application data info, the input will be re- jected and an appropriate system message will appear in the Message Line. ■ Characteristic group The attribute Characteristic group shows the name of the assigned application data characteristic group. Handling of Application Data References Application data references deﬁne relations between application data elements. Each ap- plication data element provides a number of reference “terminals” that may point to other application data elements. This can be achieved by assigning a technological address to a reference “terminal” of the respective application data element. The Application Data Info Form supports this feature by providing a separate Application Data Reference Worksheet that can be used to view, enter or modify the technological addresses of referenced appli- cation data elements (for further details on the Application Data Reference Worksheet, refer to the section  ’Application Data Reference Worksheet’ on page 164). List Available Application Data References 1. Select the Application Data Reference Worksheet by clicking the radio button Referenc- es in the worksheet selection group. 2. Select an application data element (either by previously setting a technological ad- dress as a preset value in the Presets Block of the Job Management Form or by en- Application Data Forms tering a technological address in the Master Block of the Application Data Info Form in query mode). 3. SDM performs a query on the application data references of the selected application data element and lists the available application data references in the Application Data Reference Tabular List of the Application Data Reference Worksheet. Creating Application Data References 1. Select an application data element and bring up the Application Data Reference Work- sheet as described in the section ’List Available Application Data References’ above. 2. Create a reference between a reference “terminal” of the selected application data el- ement and another application data element by entering the technological address of the concerned application data element in that line of the Application Data Reference Tabular List that shows the name of the desired reference “terminal” in the column Ref- erence. 3.",

      "---> e.g., substation, line ■ B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level ■ B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identiﬁcation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identiﬁer, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. ☞ Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speciﬁc data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 ’Applicable documents’ on page 296 in this chapter The ﬁrst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- ﬁnes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section ’Auto Creation of Element and Info Records’ on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the deﬁnition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are deﬁned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section ’Auto Creation of Element and Info Records’ below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are deﬁned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to deﬁne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- ﬁned/satisﬁed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. ☞ Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for ﬁnding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 ’Applicable documents’ on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the deﬁnition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. ☞ Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data deﬁnition (IDD) ﬁle, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). ☞ Note: Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD ﬁle, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data Deﬁnition (IDD) is conﬁgured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated ﬁlltab ﬁles located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data deﬁnition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record deﬁnitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section ’Data Collection Guidelines’ on page 297 and section ’General Format Guidelines’ on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: ■ AD_INFO ■ AD_REFERENCE ■ SCHEDULE ■ AD_CALC_INFO ■ AD_CHARAC_GROUP ■ AD_CHARAC ■ AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in ﬁles. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions Throughout this document, the term “record” is deﬁned as a string of characters subdivided into data item ﬁelds that are delimited by some record separator. Each ﬁeld is used for the entry of data values for speciﬁc attributes of power system equipment and other entities. ☞ Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.",
      "6. Paste the technological addresses from the internal clipboard into the currently select- ed data record of your SDM form by pressing the button Paste in the SDM Toolbar of the respective SDM form. ☞ Note: If the cursor is currently located in a tabular list and you are going to paste several technological addresses, the technological addresses will be inserted in the appropri- ate columns of successive rows in the list. For example: Let’s assume your SDM form contains a tabular list with columns repre- senting a technological address. Your cursor is currently located in the ﬁrst row of this list. Now, you perform a query using the Query Window and you copy and paste 3 technological addresses. The ﬁrst technological address will be inserted into the ap- propriate columns of the row where the cursor is located, the second technological ad- dress in the appropriate columns of the next row, and so on. The List Of Values (LOV) Feature Any attribute of a data entity may have an associated static list of valid values. This list may either be deﬁned in the concerned database table of the source database or may be estab- lished for the concerned form component during the form creation. SDM Basics SDM forms support these lists by the List Of Values (LOV) feature. A list of values is a scrol- lable list in a separate window that pops up if you double-click on an input ﬁeld that has an assigned list of valid values (for an example, see ﬁgure 4 on page 14). List of Values Window The List of Values Window contains a scrollable pick list that shows a list of single-column or multi-column entries from which you can select a single, distinct value (in case of sin- gle-column entries) or a set of values (in case of multi-column entries). The list entries cor- respond to columns in a database table or to static values that have been established during the form creation (see ﬁrst paragraph of the section ’The List Of Values (LOV) Feature’ above). FIGURE  4 Example of a List of Values Window A list of values appears as a modal window which can be moved and resized. It contains the following components: ■ Find ﬁeld The Find ﬁeld can be used to search speciﬁc list entries (refer to the section ’Search- ing speciﬁc list entries’ on page 15 for further details). ■ List panel The List panel shows the LOV entries (single-column entries or multi-column entries).

Organizational SDM Forms Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form can be selected from the menu Tools in the SDM Menubar and from other SDM forms (refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for details). It provides facilities that allow you to create IDD ﬁles for ASCII data import from the data of the Operational Database (ODB). FIGURE  35 Basic Structure of the Reverse Transfer Form The Reverse Transfer Form is composed of the following components: ■ SDM Menubar ■ Message Line ■ Status Line These form components are common in all SDM forms. For a detailed description, please refer to the corresponding sections in chapter 3, section ’SDM Basics’ on page 3 in this document. ■ Detail Block This form component is described in detail in the following section. SDM Menubar Message Line Status Line Detail Block Organizational SDM Forms Detail Block The Detail Block of the Reverse Transfer Form provides the following attributes: ■ Subsystem Radiobuttons for selection of the subsystem: – SCADA – TCI – Elcom – ICCP – NA – DT – Type – Control Data ■ Hierarchy Name Radiobuttons for selection of B1 or Application Data or Connection (if B1 or Application Data is selected, then a ﬁeld for input of a B1 name is provided).

      "---> e.g., substation, line ■ B1/ B2/.. ---> e.g., voltage level ■ B1/B2/B3 ---> e.g., network components, switchbays The switchbays and network components contain elements. The B1/B2/B3 triplet, along with the element, provides a unique identiﬁcation for ODB data records. Finally, each ele- ment contains various technological data units (infos). This 5-level hierachy is used to iden- tify information uniquely in the system. B1/B2/B3/Element/Info This combination is referred to as the Technological Address (TA). When processed by the SDM system, it becomes a technological identiﬁer, which is used to identify the information uniquely in the database. ☞ Note: Detailed information on the technological address and other basic concepts of the power system data model can be obtained from the document U-SC20, Base Applica- tions Data Analysis. Descriptions of application-speciﬁc data analysis methods can be obtained from the concerned data analysis user guide. For a list of applicable docu- ments, see table 2 ’Applicable documents’ on page 296 in this chapter The ﬁrst step of data preparation consists of identifying the blocks in the system. In general, the B1-record is used to identify the substations and lines in the system. The B2-record de- ﬁnes the various voltage levels within each station or line. The B3-record contains the name, block type, topology type, etc. of the switchbay or the network component. The block Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions type and the topology type of the switchbay or network component (on the B3-record), are best determined from examination of single-line diagrams. The SDM will, based on the to- pology type and block type found on the B3 record, create a skeletal set of Element records (refer to the section ’Auto Creation of Element and Info Records’ on page 298 in this chap- ter). After the deﬁnition of the blocks, the elements within the switchbays and network compo- nents are deﬁned with Element records. The element type chosen for each element deter- mines what data units are associated with the element and how that information is pro- cessed. The SDM will, based on the element name and element type found on the Element record, create a skeletal set of Info records (refer to the section ’Auto Creation of Element and Info Records’ below). This sequence of data preparation is repeated for all substations, lines, voltage levels, switchbays and network components in your system. After switchbays and network compo- nents are deﬁned, the SDM order Referenc can be used to deﬁne the connectivity between B3-blocks. This connection information and the topology type of each block is needed by Supervisory Control and Network Coloring functions. Multiple reference records will have to be created. The number of records depends on which type of references are being de- ﬁned/satisﬁed. If the references are from the switchbay to network components, the topol- ogy type of the switchbay will determine how many reference records are required. If the references are from a non-busbar network component to a busbar, the type of network com- ponent determines how many references are needed. ☞ Note: Use the concerned data analysis user guide as a source for ﬁnding standard names and data. For a list of applicable documents, see table 2 ’Applicable documents’ on page 296 in this chapter Auto Creation of Element and Info Records When a B3-record is inserted into the database, its block type and topology type are used to determine a minimum number of elements necessary to complete the deﬁnition of that B3-block. These elements are automatically inserted into the element table in the database with a -null- in the element type column. ☞ Note: You must correct the element type name for these elements prior to doing a job trans- fer. If import is running and the element is encountered in the import data deﬁnition (IDD) ﬁle, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD Element record. When an element is inserted into the database, its element name and its element type are used to determine a minimum number of data units (infos) necessary to complete the def- inition of that Element. These data units are automatically inserted into the appropriate da- tabase tables (analog value, digital, accumulator or application data). ☞ Note: Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions You must update the other attributes of the info prior to job transfer. If import is running and the data unit is encountered in the IDD ﬁle, the attributes are updated to match whatever is on the IDD info record. Application Data The application data Import Data Deﬁnition (IDD) is conﬁgured in the Oracle tables IDDUG_RECORD and IDDUG_FIELD. These tables have associated ﬁlltab ﬁles located in: $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/iddug_record.ad and $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/schema/prime/filltab/zz_iddug_field.ad The start and end constants for the application data import data deﬁnition are described in $SPECPATH/src/code/im_sdb/include/ImIddugAD.h . This chapter also presents the data import record deﬁnitions for application data, applica- tion data characteristic groups and schedules. These data is arranged hierarchically ac- cording to its function. For a complete description of the presentation format, see section ’Data Collection Guidelines’ on page 297 and section ’General Format Guidelines’ on page 299. IDD descriptions are required for those application data stored in the following source da- tabase tables: ■ AD_INFO ■ AD_REFERENCE ■ SCHEDULE ■ AD_CALC_INFO ■ AD_CHARAC_GROUP ■ AD_CHARAC ■ AD_CHARAC_SEGMENT General Format Guidelines All source data for import consists of text records that reside in ﬁles. This data may be cre- ated by whatever means is most readily available and convenient to you, including batch generation from data stored in another computer system, export from the SINAUT Spec- trum source database, and/or interactive editing. Base Applications Import Data Deﬁnitions Throughout this document, the term “record” is deﬁned as a string of characters subdivided into data item ﬁelds that are delimited by some record separator. Each ﬁeld is used for the entry of data values for speciﬁc attributes of power system equipment and other entities. ☞ Note: Control codes such as TAB are not permitted in import data as delimiters or for any oth- er purpose. The only exceptions are for the normal end-of-line codes such as carriage return and line feed.",
