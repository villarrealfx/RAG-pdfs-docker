It is pos- sible to de\\ufb01ne rules to combine any informations within a block (block B1, block B2, block B3). If a network state is to be displayed on-line, the information is derived from the techno- logical address of the respective block identi\\ufb01cation. The block identi\\ufb01cation for on-line ac- cess, when displaying a network state, is derived from the technological address of the in- formation to be displayed. This decision table is preferably to used for all different logical operations within one network element group.
