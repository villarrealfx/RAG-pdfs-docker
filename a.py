Organizational SDM Forms Command Block The Command Block of the Job Trace Form differs from the standard Command Block con- tained in a SDM form (see section ’Command Block’ on page 26 for details). It contains the following button: ■ Cancel Exits the Job Trace Form. If you press this button, the Job Trace Form will be closed and the Job Management Form will appear. Trace Message List The Trace Message List is a tabular list that shows trace information of that job whose job name is currently displayed in the input ﬁeld of the attribute Job Name in the Selection Block. Each line of the tabular list represents a single trace message, i.e., a single action performed by the respective job. The columns of the list contain the attributes of the respec- tive trace message. A scrollbar is attached to the tabular list which can be used to quickly navigate through the list. Changes in the list are updated automatically.',

Fur- ther details on the Duplicate feature can be obtained from the description of the button Du- plicate on page 24. SDM Basics The Basic Structure of SDM Forms All SDM forms are composed of the same basic form components. This common standard- ized structure supports the operator in becoming familiar with the SDM forms. However, de- pending on the form’s intended purpose certain SDM forms will not need some of the com- ponents provided by the common structure and the structure of other SDM forms will slight- ly deviate from this standard. Those differences are indicated in the subsequent SDM form descriptions. The following ﬁgure 5 shows you the standardized form components using the Application Data Info Form as an example. FIGURE  5 Basic Structure of a SDM form Each SDM form is composed of the following form components: ■ SDM Menubar SDM Toolbar SDM Menubar Job Block Command Block Detail Block Message Line Master Block Status Line SDM Basics ■ SDM Toolbar ■ Job Block ■ Master Block (optional) ■ Command Block ■ Detail Block ■ Message Line ■ Status Line SDM Menubar Each SDM form provides a menu bar (the “SDM Menubar”), which is located at the top of an SDM form and runs across the entire SDM form (see ﬁgure 6 below). FIGURE  6 SDM Menubar The SDM Menubar contains the following menus: ■ File The File menu provides form-related actions. For example: Exit from form. ■ Job Use the Job menu to select organizational SDM forms dealing with job and task man- agement, such as Job Management Form, Job Log Form, Job Trace Form, Job Inter- lock Form, etc. ■ Tools Perform various SDM actions by selecting organizational SDM forms like the Model Form, Reverse Transfer Form, etc. ■ Reports Create application-speciﬁc reports by selecting the appropriate form via the Reports menu. ■ Help Get online help Information by selecting the appropriate help topic from the Help menu. The following menus can be used to access application-speciﬁc SDM forms: ■ SCADA SDM Menubar SDM Basics ■ AD ■ TCI ■ ELCOM ■ ICCP ■ NA ■ DMS ■ Graphic SDM Toolbar The SDM Toolbar is a row of buttons located beneath the SDM Menubar and provides fast access to important SDM features, e.g., creating, editing or deleting a data record, etc. (for an example of a SDM Toolbar, see ﬁgure 7 below). FIGURE  7 Example of a SDM Toolbar The standard SDM Toolbar provides seven buttons (see description below). These buttons are available in each application-speciﬁc SDM form. ☞ Note: Other buttons may be available depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation. Depending on the selected SDM form and the current situation, some of the provided buttons may be disabled. Buttons provided in the SDM Toolbar will be enabled or dis- abled dynamically. If more buttons are available than the eight buttons described below, refer to the de- scription of the concerned SDM form for more information on those buttons. The content of the SDM Toolbar in organizational SDM forms might deviate from the described SDM Toolbar conﬁguration. If so, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form for more information on the speciﬁc SDM Toolbar. ■ Query If the concerned SDM form is already in Query Mode, pressing the button Query performs a query based on the entered Query Criteria. If the concerned SDM form was not in Query Mode, pressing the button Query puts the form into Query Mode. SDM Toolbar SDM Basics For more details on the Query Mode and queries, refer to the section ’Queries’ on page 6. ■ ExitQuery If the concerned SDM form is in Query Mode, pressing the button ExitQuery leaves the Query Mode without performing a query. ■ Insert Insert new (empty) data record. Pressing the button Insert creates a new data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, a new blank row is inserted into the list beneath that row where cursor is located. ☞ Note: Insert creates a new record, but does not store it. If you want to store the new data record, press the button OK or the button Apply in the Command Block of the con- cerned SDM form. For more details on the Command Block, refer to the section ’Com- mand Block’ on page 26. In case the button Insert is disabled you are currently not allowed to insert a new data record. ■ Delete Remove one or more data records from the database. Pressing the button Delete removes the currently selected data record. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) is removed. ☞ Note: You will not be allowed to remove a data record if there are pending data modiﬁcations on any attribute of the concerned data record. If the SDM form detects uncommitted data modiﬁcations it will request you to commit those modiﬁcations or to perform a roll- back on those modiﬁcations before you can proceed with your deletion. If the data record to be removed has associated data records in other database tables (so-called “Child Records”), those data records will also be removed. This is called ”Cascading Delete”. For example, if you remove an application data characteristic group record, this data record may have associated application data characteristic records and these may have associated characteristic segment records. If you press the button Delete to remove the application data characteristic group record all associ- ated application data characteristic records and all associated characteristic segment records will also be removed. If the data record you are about to remove has associated child records, an alert win- dow will pop up informing you that a cascading delete will be performed. At this point you can cancel the deletion or continue it by pressing the appropriate button in the alert window. ☞ Note: SDM Basics Sometimes you may encounter a long waiting time while a delete transaction is per- formed. This will especially be the case if a deletion is performed which removes a large amount of data from the database (e.g., in case of a cascading delete). Since a lot of activity takes place beneath the surface in such a case, we recommend that you break such transactions down into several smaller transactions. For example, when re- moving a large B1 block, it would be better, to delete each B2 block individually rather than to delete the entire B1 block at once. An attempt to perform a delete transaction which is too large to delete may cause an errors, especially if the system is rather busy. Deletions will automatically change the database. Once a deletion is initiated, it cannot be rolled back. To reverse the effects of a deletion, use the Cancel Task feature in the Task Log Form (see section  ’Task Log Form’ on page 60 for more details on this topic). No speciﬁc alert window will appear if a cascading delete removes child data records used in other source database tables. The inconsistency that occurs in such a case will be detected during a global validation. ■ Defaults Assign pre-deﬁned default values to the attributes of the currently selected data record. Columns of a source database table may have associated default values which are also deﬁned in the source database. If default values are available for the selected data record, the current attribute values will be replaced by the speciﬁed default values after you have pressed the button Defaults. ☞ Note: If no default values are available for the selected data record, the button Defaults will be disabled. If you intend to use default values on a data record, we recommend to use the Defaults feature before you enter any other information for this data record, since default values will overwrite all related items you have already entered for this data record. ■ Clear Remove the content of the input ﬁelds of the selected data record. If you press the button Clear, the content of all input ﬁelds of the currently selected data record will be emptied. The content of these ﬁelds will also be removed from the work space (for more information on the work space, refer tot the section ’Applying Trans- actions’ on page 17). ☞ Note: Unlike Delete (see description on page 22), pressing the button Clear will not remove the concerned data record from the database. SDM Basics If you did not apply your data modiﬁcations on the currently selected data record yet, and you have pressed the button Clear, the entire data record will be removed. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be removed. ■ Duplicate Duplicate the preceding data record and insert this copy as a new data record. If you press the button Duplicate, a copy of the preceding data record will be inserted as a new data record. ☞ Note: Attributes that require unique information will not be copied and the concerned input ﬁelds in the new data record will be left blank. If the cursor is located in a tabular list, the currently selected row (the row where the cursor is located) will be copied and in- serted as a new row below the selected row. ■ MSG Open the Error Message Form. Pressing the button MSG opens the Error Message Form that shows the error messag- es of the job you are currently connected to. For a detailed description of the informa- tion displayed in the Error Message Form, refer to the section ’Error Message Form’ on page 72. ■ Longhint Display a long hint text. Move the cursor to the input ﬁeld of an attribute and press the button Longhint. Then, the long hint associated with the respective attribute will be displayed in the Message Line of the respective SDM form. ☞ Note: Just like “short” hints (see section ’Hints’ on page 6 for details), long hints must be de- ﬁned in the source database table where the concerned attribute is deﬁned. If no long hint is available for the respective attribute, the button Longhint will be dis- abled. The accessibility of the button Longhint may change every time you move the cursor to another input ﬁeld depending on the availability of a long hint in the con- cerned source database table. Job Block The Job Block is located in the upper left corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains display ﬁelds showing job information and job interlock information. SDM Basics FIGURE  8 Example of a Job Block ■ Job Shows the name of the job accessing the respective SDM form. ■ Job Interlock If a job interlock for the entire SDM form exists, the display ﬁeld of the attribute Job Interlock shows the name of the locking job. ☞ Note: Depending on the hierarchical level of the data presented by the form, this attribute might not appear. For more details on job interlocks, refer to the section ’Job Inter- locks’ on page 4. Master Block The Master Block is an optional form component. Its availability in a SDM form depends on the form’s intended purpose and the hierarchical level of the data presented by the respec- tive SDM form. The Master Block provides attributes representing the primary database keys of the con- cerned data object. The input ﬁelds of the provided attributes are used to enter query crite- ria when performing a query. ☞ Note: Before you can use the Master Block, you must switch to Query Mode. For more de- tails on the Query Mode, refer to the section  ’Query Mode’ on page 7. For detailed information on the availability of a master block in a speciﬁc SDM form and its content, refer to the description of the concerned SDM form. Job SDM Basics FIGURE  9 Example of a Master Block Command Block The command block is located in the upper right corner of an SDM form just below the SDM Toolbar and contains the following buttons to apply and discard data modiﬁcations per- formed in the SDM form: ■ OK Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database and exits the concerned SDM form. ■ Apply Applies the performed data modiﬁcations to the database. The concerned SDM form remains and further data modiﬁcations can be performed. ■ Cancel Dismisses the performed data modiﬁcations. The data modiﬁcations will not be ap- plied to the database.',
